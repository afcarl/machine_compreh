        "question": "why do the professor discuss frantzen 's difficulty as a young painter",

        "context": "ok we have be talk about how throughout history it be often difficult for people to give up idea which have long be take for grant as scientific truth even if those idea be false. in astronomy for example the distinction between the solar system and the universe be not clear until modern time. the ancient greek believe that what we call the solar system be in fact the entire universe and that the universe be geocentric. geocentric means earth centered so the geocentric view hold that the sun the planet and the star all revolve around the earth which be stationary. of course we now know that the planet include earth revolve around the sun and that the solar system be only a tiny part of the universe. so why do the ancient greek believe that the earth be the center of the universe. well it make sense to they. observation of the sky make it appear as if the sun the moon and the star all revolve around the earth everyday while the earth itself stay in one place. and this view be also support by they philosophical and religious belief about the origin and structure of the universe. it be present in the work of well know greek philosopher as early as the fourth century b. and the geocentric theory continue to prevail in western thought for almost 2 year until the 17th century. now what be especially interesting be that when astronomical observation be make that seem to be inconsistent with the geocentric view the ancient greek do not really consider alternative theory. it be so intuitive so sensible that the earth be the center of the universe that astronomer find way to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomenon within the geocentric view. for example greek astronomer make excellent very accurate observation of the movement of the planet but the observation reveal a bit of a problem. the geocentric theory say that the planet would move around the earth in one direction. however astronomer notice that at time several planet seem to stop move in one direction and start move backward in they orbit around the earth and they come up with a theory that these planet themselves move in smaller circle call epicycle as they travel around the earth. here be a picture of what they imagine. you see how this epicycle theory could account for the seemingly backward motion of the planet. of course today we know that this appearance of backward motion be cause by the fact that earth as well as other planet all move in they own orbit around the sun and the relative movement of the planet with respect to each other can get quite complex. however there be a few astronomer in greece and other place who do not agree with the geocentric view for example a greek astronomer who live in the third century b. he propose the theory that we planetary system might be heliocentric he name be aristarchus. heliocentric means sun centered that the earth revolve around the sun. aristarchus recognize from he calculation that the sun be much larger than the earth and other planet. it be probably this discovery that lead he to conclude that the universe be heliocentric. i mean be not it more sensible to think that a smaller heavenly body would orbit a larger one rather than the opposite. however he proposition be reject largely base on other scientific belief hold at the time which all make sense in a way even if they be incorrect. let i mention two objection greek make to aristarchus 's theory. first they believe that everything that move create its own wind so to speak everyone have this experience when you be run right. so they think that if the earth itself be move there would have to be a constant wind blowing sweep they off they foot and of course there be not. and second the idea of a earth that move do not fit in with the ancient greek understanding of gravity. they think that gravity be basically a natural tendency of all thing to move towards the center of the universe which be the earth or the center of the earth so that explain why apple and other fall object be fall straight down. if the sun be at the center of the universe thing would fall toward the sun and away from the earth which of course they do not. so these be some of the reason they reject the heliocentric theory.",

        "question": "why do the professor mention the brown tree snake", 
        "context": "probably back in some previous biology course you learn that snake evolve from lizard and that the first snake be not venomous and then along come more advanced snake the venomous snake. ok venomous snake be the one that secrete poisonous substance or venom like the snake of the viper family or cobra. then there be non venomous snake like constrictor and python. another family of snake the colubrid do not really fit neatly into either category though. colubrid and you probably learn this too although they be often classify as venomous snake they be actually generally non venomous. they be classify as venomous snake because they resemble they they advanced feature more than the other non venomous snake. now what if i tell you that there be a good chance that most everything i just say be wrong. well everything except the part about snake evolve from lizard. see the basic theory about snake evolution have be challenge by a recent study that reveal a whole new understanding of evolutionary relationship for reptile you know which reptile descend from which ancestor. the researcher study the protein in the venom gene of various species of colubrid. emm snake venom be a mixture of protein some toxic poisonous and some not. by analyze the dna the genetic material of the protein the researcher could focus on the toxic gene and use they to trace the evolution of snake venom and from this the evolution of snake. traditionally to understand evolutionary relationship we look at various easily observe physical characteristic of animal they skeleton the size of they brain and and then classify they base on similarity and difference. the problem with this method be that characteristic that appear similar may actually have develop in quite different way. for example some venom be chemical base and other be bacterium base so they clearly have to have develop along different route and may not be as closely related as we think. now and not everyone will agree about this. the classification base on dna seem to be much more reliable. ok back to the research. the researcher find that venom evolve before snake even exist about a hundred million year before. now a couple of venomous lizard be include in this study. and the researcher find some of the same dna in they venom as in the snake venom. this suggest that the common ancestor of all snake be actually venomous lizard which mean that actually accord to this research anyway in term of the snake ancestry there be no such thing as a non venomous snake not even colubrid. what separate colubrid from other snake we have be classify be venomous be not the lack of venom but the lack of a effective way to deliver the venom into its prey. in most venomous snake like viper and cobra the venom be use to catch and inmoblize the prey but in colubrid venom drip onto the prey only after the prey be in the snake 's mouth. so for colubrid the venom must serve some other purpose maybe link to digest prey. as the different family of venomous snake evolve the tooth move forward become larger and the venom become stronger so the evolution of the obvious venomous snake like cobra and viper be about the evolution of a efficient delivery system not so much the evolution of the venom itself. so if there be no truly non venomous snake be the so call non venomous snake like constrictor and python be they venomous at some point in they evolution. well that be not clear at this point. constrictor have evolve to kill they prey by crush but perhaps they once be venomous and then at some point they venom produce apparatus4 be not need anymore so it gradually disappear. there be one species of snake the brown tree snake that use both constriction and venom depend on its prey. so well it be possible. so we have these new concept of snake evolution and a new dna database all these information on the genetic makeup of snake venom. and what we have learn from this have lead researcher to believe that venom protein may have some exciting application in the field of medical research. you see venom alter biological function in the same way certain drug do and the big benefit of drug make from snake venom would be that they target only certain cell so maybe that will create fewer side effect. now it sound far fetched5 venom be the basis for human drug. so far only one protein have be target for study as a potential drug but who know maybe someday.",

        "context": "as geologist we examine layer of sediment on the earth 's surface to approximate the date of past geologic time period. uh sediment as you know be material like sand gravel fossil fragment that be transport by natural process like wind water flow or the movement of glacier. so sediment be transport and then deposit and it form layer on the earth 's surface over time. we examine these layer to learn about different geologic time period include when they begin and end. for example from about 1. 8 million year ago to around 11 thousand year ago be the pleistocene epoch. the pleistocene epoch be a ice age. during this epoch sediment be make by the kind of erosion and weather that happen when the climate be colder and part of those sediment be fossil of plant and animal that live at that time. the holocene epoch follow the pleistocene epoch when the earth 's climate warm up around 11 thousand year ago. the holocene epoch be characterize by different sediment one that form when the climate be warmer. because the climate change the type of plant and animal change also. holocene sediment contain remnant of more recent plant and animal so it be pretty easy to differentiate geologically between these two epoch. now there be grow evidence that the presence of human have alter the earth so much that a new epochc of geologic history have begin the anthropocene epoch a new human influence epoch. this idea that we have enter a new anthropocene epoch be first propose in 2 2. the idea be that around the year 18 ce the human population become large enough around a billion people that its activity start alter the environment. this be also the time of the industrial revolution which bring a tremendous increase in the use of fossil fuel such as coal. the exploitation of fossil fuel have bring planetwide development industrialization construction uh mass transport. and these development have cause major change like additional erosion of the earth 's surface and deforestation. also thing like the damming of river have cause increase sediment production not to mention the addition of more carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. naturally all these change show up in recent sediment. and these sediment be quite different from pre year 18 sediment layer. interestingly there be some speculation that human start have a major impact on earth much earlier about 8 year ago. that be when agriculture be become widespread. early farmer start clear forest and livestock produce a lot of extra methane. but i want to stress this be just a hypothesis. the idea that early human could have have such a major effect well i be just not sure we can compare it with the industrial age. geologist in the far future will be able to examine the sediment be lay down today whereas right now we can say that yes human impact on the earth be clear it will be future researcher who have a better perspective and will be able to really draw a line between the holocene and the anthropocene epoch.",

        "context": "now we have get a few minute before we leave for today. so i will just touch on a interesting subject that i think make a important point. we have be cover rock and different type of rock for the last several week. but next week we be go to do something a bit different. and to get start i think i would mention something that show how uh as a geologist you need to know about more than just rock and the structure of solid matter. move rock you may have hear about they. it be quite a mystery. death valley be this desert plain a dry lake bed in california surround by mountain and on the desert floor these huge rock some of they hundred of pound. they leave long trail behind they track you might say as they move from one point to another. but nobody have be able to figure out how they be move because no one have ever see it happen. now there be a lot of theory but all we know for sure be that people be not move the rock. there be no footprint no type track and no heavy machinery like a bulldozer uh nothing be ever bring in to move these heavy rock. so what be go on. some researcher think powerful uh windstorm might move the rock. most of the rock move in the same direction as the dominant wind pattern from southwest to northeast. but some and this be interesting move straight west while some zigzag or even move in large circle. hmm how can that be. how about wind combine with rain. the ground of this desert be make of clay. it be a desert so it be dry. but when there be the occasional rain the clay ground become extremely slippery. it be hard for anyone to stand on walk on. some scientist theorize that perhaps when the ground be slippery the high wind can then move the rock. there be a problem with this theory. one team of scientist flood a area of the desert with water then try to establish how much wind force would be necessary to move the rock. and get this you need wind of at least five hundred mile a hour to move just the smallest rock. and wind that strong have never be record. so i think it be safe to say that that issue have be settle. here be another possibility ice. it be possible that rain on the desert floor could turn to thin sheet of ice when temperature drop at night. so if rock uh become embedded in ice uh ok could a piece of ice with rock in it be push around by the wind. but there be a problem with this theory too. rock trap in ice together would have move together when the ice move. but that do not always happen. the rock seem to take separate route. there be a few other theory. maybe the ground vibrate or maybe the ground itself be shift tilt. maybe the rock be move by a magnetic force. but sadly all these idea have be eliminate as possibility. there be just no evidence. i bet you be say to yourself well why do not scientist just set up video camera to record what actually happen. thing be this be a protected wilderness area. so by law that type of research be not allow. besides in powerful windstorm sensitive camera equipment would be destroy. so why can not researcher just live there for a while until they observe the rock move. so where be we now. well right now we still do not have any answer. so all this lead back to my main point you need to know about more than just rock as geologist. the researcher study move rock well they combine they knowledge of rock with knowledge of wind ice and such uh not successfully not yet. but you know they would not even have be able to get start without um earth science understanding knowledge about wind storm you know meteorology. you need to understand physics. so for several week like i say we will be address geology from a wider perspective. i guess that be all for today.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what change have cause uranium lead date to gain popularity recently", 
        "context": "ok let 's get start. today i want to talk about a way in which we be able to determine how old a piece of land or some other geologic feature be date technique. i be go to talk about a particular date technique. good date be key to good analysis. in other word if you want to know how a land formation be form the first thing you probably want to know be how old it be. uh take the grand canyon for instance. now we geologist think we have a pretty good idea of how the grand canyon in the southwestern united state be form. we know that it be form from sandstone that solidify somewhere between 15 and 3 million year ago. before it solidify it be just regular sand. essentially it be part of a vast desert. and until just recently most of we think the sand have come from a ancient mountain range fairly close by that flatten out over time. that be be the conventional wisdom among geologist for quite some time. but now we have learn something different and quite surprising use a technique call uranium lead date. i should say that uranium lead date have be around for quite a while. but there have be some recent refinement. i will get into this in a minute. anyway uranium lead date have produce some surprise. two geologist discover that about half of the sand from the grand canyon be actually once part of the appalachian mountain. that be really eye open news since the appalachian mountain range be of course thousand of kilometer to the east of the grand canyon. sound pretty unbelievable right. of course the obvious question be how do that sand end up so far west. the theory be that huge river and wind carry the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that be already there. well this be a pretty revolutionary finding. um and it be basically because of uranium lead date. well as everyone in this class should know we usually look at the grain type within sandstone mean the actual particle in the sandstone to determine where it come from. you can do other thing too like look at the wind or water that bring the grain to they location and figure out which way it be flow. but that be only useful up to a point and that be not what these two geologist do. uranium lead date allow they to go about it in a entirely different way. what they do be they look at the grain of zircon in the sandstone. zircon be a material that contain radioactive uranium which make it very useful for date purpose. zircon start off as molten magma the hot lava from volcano. and when zircon crystallize the uranium inside it begin to change into lead. so if you measure the amount of lead in the zircon grain you can figure out when the grain be form. after that you can determine the age of zircon from different mountain range. once you do that you can compare the age of the zircon in the sandstone in you sample to the age of the zircon in the mountain. if the age of the zircon match the age of one of the mountain range then it mean the sandstone actually use to be part of that particular mountain range. be everybody with i on that. so in this case uranium lead date be use to establish that half of the sandstone in the sample be form at the same time the granite in the appalachian mountain be form. so because of this this new way of do uranium lead date we have be able to determine that one of we major assumption about the grand canyon be wrong. like i say before uranium lead date have be with we for a while. but um until recently in order to do it you really have to study many individual grain. and it take a long time before you get result. it just be not very efficient. and it be not very accurate. but technical advance have cut down on the number of grain you have to study so you get you result faster. so i will predict that uranium lead date be go to become a increasingly popular date method. there be a few pretty exciting possibility for uranium lead date. here be one that come to mind. you know the theory that earth 's continent be once join together and only split apart relatively recently. well with uranium lead date we could prove that more conclusively. if they show evidence of once have be join that could really tell we a lot about the early history of the planet 's geology.",

        "context": "when land get develop for human use the landscape change. we do not see as many type of vegetation tree grass and so forth. this in turn lead to other loss the loss of animal that once live there. err but these be the obvious change but there be also less obvious change like the climate. one interesting case of this uh of change in the local land use cause change in climate specifically the temperature be in florida. now what come to mind when you think of the state of florida. florida have long have a great citrus industry large growth of orange lemon and the like. florida 's winter be very mild the temperature do not often get below freezing. but there be some area of florida that do freeze. so in the early 19 's farmer move even further south in florida to area that be even less likely to freeze. obviously freezing temperature be a danger to the crop. a bad bout of cold weather a long spell of frost could ruin a farmer 's entire crop anyway before the citrus grower move south much of the land in south florida be what we call wetland. wetland be area of marshy swampy land area where water cover the soil or be present either at or near the surface of the soil for a large part of the year. wetland have they own unique ecosystem with plant and animal with special and interesting adaptation. very exciting but it be not what we be talk about today. but the land be not suitable for farm. you can not grow orange in wetland so farmer have to transform the wetland into land suitable for farm. to do that you have to drain the water from the land move the water elsewhere and divert the water source such as river. hundred of mile of drainage canal be build in the wetland. now these area the new area the farmer move to use to be warm and unlikely to freeze however recently the area have become susceptible to freeze. and we be try to understand why. be it some global temperature change or weather pattern like el ni o or something. well there be two theory. one idea be as you suggest that major weather pattern something like el ni o be responsible. but the other idea and this be the one that i personally subscribe to be that the change in the temperature pattern have be bring about by the loss of the wetland. well how would loss of wetland make a difference. well think about what we have be study so far. we have discuss the impact of landscape on temperature right. what effect do a body of water have on a area. body of water tend to absorb the heat during the day and then they release the heat at night. what you just say be what i want you all to understand. body of water release heat and moisture back into the environment. so place near large body of water be generally milder err slightly warmer than those without water. and what i and other think be that the loss of the wetland have create a situation where the local temperature in the area be now slightly different slightly colder than they be 1 year ago before the wetland be drain. hmm do we know what the temperature be like back then. well we be able to estimate this. we have datum about south florida 's current landscape uh the plant cover. and we be able to reconstruct datum about its landscape prior to 19. then we enter those datum information about what the landscape look like before and after the wetland be drain. we enter the datum into a computer weather model. this model can predict temperature. and when all of the datum be enter a overall cooling trend be predict by the model. how much colder do it get now. well actually the model show a drop of only a few degree celsius. but this be enough to cause dramatic damage to crop. if temperature overnight be already very close to the freezing point then this drop of just a few degree can take the temperature below freezing. and freezing cause frost which kill crop. these damaging frost would not happen if the wetland be still in existence just a tiny temperature difference can have major consequence.",

        "question": "why do the professor mention ancient greek theater", 
        "context": "the word opera mean work actually it mean work. it be the plural of the word opus from the latin. and in italian it refer in general to work of art. opera lyrica or lyric opera refer to what we think of as opera the musical drama. opera be commonplace in italy for almost a thousand year before it become commercial as a venture. and during those year several thing happen primarily linguistic or thematic and both involve secularization. musical drama start in the church. it be a educational tool. it be use primarily as a vehicle for teaching religion and be generally present in latin the language of the christian church which have considerable influence in italy at that time. but the language of everyday life be evolve in europe and at a certain point in the middle age it be really only merchant aristocrat and clergy who could deal with latin. the vast majority of the population use they own regional vernacular in all aspect of they life. and so in what be now italy opera quit be present in latin and start be present in italian. and once that happen the theme of the opera presentation also start to change. and musical drama move from the church to the plaza right outside the church. and the theme again the theme change. and opera be no longer about teaching religion as it be about satire and about express the idea of society or government without commit yourself to write and risk imprisonment or persecution or what have you. opera as we think of it be of course a resurrect form. it be the melodious drama of ancient greek theater the term melodious drama be shorten eventually to melodrama because opera frequently be melodramatic not to say unrealistic. and the group that put the first opera together that we have today then be well it be a group of man that include galileo 's father vincenzo and they meet in florence he and a group of friend of the count of bardi and they form what be call the camerata dei bardi. and they take classical theater and reproduce it in the renaissance time. this uh this produce some of the opera that we have today. now what happen in the following century be very simple. opera originate in italy but be not confine to italy any more than italian be. and so as italian migrate across europe they carry theater with they and opera specifically because it be a italian form. what happen be that the major divide in opera that endure today take place. the french say opera ought to reflect the rhythm and cadence of dramatic literature bear in mind that we be talk about the golden age in french literature. and so the music be secondary if you will to the dramatic cadence of language to the way the rhythm of language be use to express feeling and use to add drama and of course as a result instead of aria or solo which would come to dominate italian opera. the french rely on what the italian call recitativo or recitative in english. the lyric be speak frequently to the accompaniment of a harpsichord. the french say you really can not talk about real people who live in opera and they rely on mythology to give they they character and they plot mythology the pastoral tradition the novel of chivalry or the epic of chivalry out of the middle age. the italian say no this be a great historical tool and what better way to educate the public about nero or attila or any number of people than to put they into a play they can see and listen to. the english appropriate opera after the french. opera come late to england because all theater public theater be close of course during they civil war. and it be not until the restoration in 166 that public theater again open and opera take off. the english make a major adjustment to opera and export what they have do to opera back to italy. so that you have this circle of musical influence the italian invent opera the french adapt it the english adopt it the italian take it back. it come to america late and be consider to elitist for the general public. but broadway musical fulfil a similar function for a great long while. john jay chapman write about opera quote if a extraterrestrial being be to appear before we and say what be you society like what be this earth thing all about you could do worse than take that creature to a opera. because opera do after all begin with a man and a woman and a emotion.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what be the impact of the extensive hunting of beaver in north america", 
        "context": "so continue we discussion of ecological system whole system. the main thing to keep in mind here be the interrelationship. the species in a system uh. and even the landscape itself they be interdependent. let 's take what you read for this week and see if we can apply this interdependence idea. well um how about beaver ecosystem with beaver and waterway. good good go on. like well you can see how it be so important cause if you go back before european settle in north america like before the 16 's back when native american be the only people live here well back then there be a lot of beaver but later on after european ok wait i see where you be head with this but before we go into how european settlement affect the ecosystem tell i this what kind of environment do beaver live in. think about what it be like before the european settler come we will come back to where you be head. ok well beaver live near stream and river and they block up the stream and river with like log and stick and mud. you know they build dam that really slow down the flow of the stream. so then the water back up and create like a pond that flood the nearby land. ok tell i more. well with wetland it be like there be more standing water more still water around and that water be a lot cleaner than swiftly flow water because the dirt and sediment and stuff have a chance to sink to the bottom. more important for we discussion wetland area support a lot more variety of life than swiftly flow water. for example there be more variety of fish or insect lot of frog spice and then species that rely on those species start to live near the wetland too. yes like bird and mammal that eat the fish and insect and you get tree and plant that begin to grow near the standing water that can not grow near the run water. oh and there be something about wetland and groundwater too. wetland have a big effect on groundwater the amount of water below the surface of the land. think of wetland as umm like a giant sponge the earth soak up a lot of this water that be continually flood the surface which increase the amount of water below. so where there be wetland you get a lot of groundwater and groundwater happen to be a big source of we own drinking water today. alright so back to the beaver what if the beaver be not there. you just have a regular run stream because there be no dam so the ecosystem would be completely different there would be fewer wetland. exactly so now let 's go back to where you be head before mike. you mention a change that occur after european come to north america. yeah well there use to be beaver all over the place something like 2 million beaver just in the continental united state. but when european come they start hunting the beaver for they fur because beaver fur be really warm and it be really popular for make hat in europe. so the beaver be hunt a lot overhunt they be almost extinct by the 18 's so that mean fewer wetland less standing water. and what do that mean for the ecosystem. well if there be less standing water then the ecosystem can not support as many species because a lot of insect and fish and frog can not live in run water and then the bird and animal that eat they lose they food supply. precisely so the beaver in this ecosystem be what we call a keystone species. the term keystone kind of explain itself. in architecture a keystone in a archway or doorway be the stone that hold the whole thing together and keep it from collapse. well that be what a keystone species do in a ecosystem. it be the crucial species that keep the system go. now beaver population be on the rise again but there be something to think about. consider human as part of these ecosystem you have probably hear about water shortage or restriction on how much water you can use especially in the summer time in recent year. and remember what i say about groundwater imagine if we still have all those beaver around all those wetland. what would we water supply be like then.",

        "question": "what point do the professor make about imagination", 
        "context": "we have say that the term cognition refer to mental state like know and believe and to mental process that we use to arrive at those state. so for example reasoning be a cognitive process so be perception. we use information that we perceive through we sens to help we make decision to arrive at belief and so on. and then there be memory and imagination which relate to the knowledge of thing that happen in the past or may happen in the future. so perceive remember imagine be all internal mental process that lead to know or believe. yet each of these process have limitation and can lead we to hold mistaken belief or make false prediction. take memory for example maybe you have hear of study in which people hear a list of related word. um let 's say a list of different kind of fruit. after hear this list they be present with several additional word. in this case we will say the additional word be blanket and cherry. neither of these word be on the original list and while people will claim correctly that blanket be not on the original list they will also claim incorrectly that the word cherry be on the list. most people be convince they hear the word cherry on the original list. why do they make such a simple mistake. well we think because the word on the list be so closely related the brain store only the gist of what it hear. for example that all the item on the list be type of fruit. when we tap we memory we brain often fill in detail and quite often these detail be actually false. we also see this fill in phenomenon with perception. perception be the faculty that allow we to process information in the present as we take it in via we sens. again study have show that people will fill in information that they think they perceive even when they do not. for example experiment have be do where a person hear a sentence but it be miss the word that logically complete it. they will claim to hear that word even though it be never say. so if i be to say er the sun rise in the and then fail to complete the sentence people will often claim to have hear the word east. in cognitive psychology we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate filling in of detail it be call a blind spot. the term originally refer to the place in we eye where the optic nerve connect the back of the eye to the brain. there be no photoreceptor in the area where the nerve connect to the eye. so that particular area of the eye be incapable of detect image. it produce a blind spot in we field of vision. we be not aware of it because the brain fill in what it think belong in the image so the picture always appear complete to we. but the term blind spot have also take on a more general meaning it refer to people be unaware of a bias that may affect they judgment about a subject. and the same blind spot phenomenon that affect memory and perception also affect imagination. imagination be a faculty that some people use to anticipate future event in they life. but the ease with which we imagine detail can lead to unrealistic expectation and can bias we decision. so um peter suppose i ask you to imagine a lunch salad no problem right. but i bet you imagine specific ingredient. do yours have tomato onion lettuce. we brain fill in all sort of detail that might not be part of other people 's image of a salad which could lead to disappointment for we. if the next time we order a salad in a restaurant we have we imagine salad in mind that be not necessarily what we will get on we plate. the problem be not that we imagine thing but that we assume what we have imagine be accurate. we should be aware that we imagination have this build in feature the blind spot which make we prediction fall short of reality.",

        "context": "now in europe in the middle age before the invention of printing and the printing press all book all manuscript be hand make. and the material typically use for the page be parchment which be animal skin that be stretch and dry under tension so it become 's really flat and can be write on. during the 14 's when printing be be develop paper become the predominant material for book in europe but prior to that it be parchment. parchment be durable much more so than paper and it could be reuse which come in handy since it be a costly material and in short supply so it wasn t uncommon for the scribe or monk who produce the manuscript. ah remember before print book be make mainly in monastery. well the scribe often recycle the parchment that have be use for earlier manuscript. they simplyerase the ink off the parchment and write something new in its placea manuscript page that be write on erase and then use again ispalimpsest be create well we know about two method that be use for remove ink from parchment. in the late middle age it be customary to scrape away the surface of the parchment with a abrasive which completely wipe out any write that be there. but earlier in the middle age the original ink be usually remove by wash the use parchment with milk. but with the passing of time the original writing might reappear. in fact it might reappear to the extent that scholar could make out and even decipher the original text. perhaps the most famous example be the archimede palimpsest. archimede live in greece around 2 bce and as you probably know he be consider one of the greatest mathematician who ever live even though many of he writings have be lose include what many now think to be he most important work call the method. but in 1998 a book of prayer from the middle age sell in a art auction for a lot of money more money than anyone would pay for a damage book from the 12th century. beautiful or not why. it have be discover that the book be a palimpsest and beneath the surface writing of the manuscript lay guess what. mathematical theorem and diagram from archimede. archimede writings be originally do on papyrus scroll. then in the 1 th century a scribe make a copy on parchment of some of he text and diagram include as it turn out the method. this be extremely fortunate since later on the original papyrus scroll disappear. about 2 year later in the 12 th century this parchment manuscript become a palimpsest when a scribe use the parchment to make a prayer book. so the page the piece of parchment themselves have be preserve. but the archimede text be erase and write over and no one know it exist. it be not until 19 6 that a scholar come across the prayer book in a library and realize it be a palimpsest and that the underlie layer of text could only have come from archimede. that be when he work the method be discover for the first time. um the palimpsest then go through some more tough time but eventually it end up in a art auction where be buy and then donate to a art museum in baltimore for conservation and study. to avoid further damage to the manuscript the research team at the art museum have have to be extremely selective in the technique they use to see the original writing. they have use ultraviolet light and some other technique and if you be interested in that sort of thing you can learn more about it in a art conservation class. but actually it be a physicist who come up with a method that be a breakthrough. he realize that the iron in the ancient ink would display if expose to a certain x ray imaging method and except for small portion of the text that could not be decipher this technique 's be very helpful in see archimede text and drawing through the medieval overwriting.",

        "question": "accord to the professor why do beaver generally forage at night", 
        "context": "let 's continue we discussion about animal behavior by talk about decision that animal face complex one. animal even insect carry out what look like very complex decision make process. i mean no one really think that say a bee go through weigh the pro and con of pollinate this flower or that flower. but then how do animal solve complex question question that seem to require decision making. the answer we will propose of course be that they behavior be largely a matter of natural selection. as a example let 's look at forage behavior among beaver. beaver eat plant mostly tree. and they also use tree and tree branch to construct they home in stream and lake. so when they do forage for food and for shelter material they have to leave they home and go up on land where they main predator be. so there be a number of choice that have to be make about forage. so for example um they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down. some tree have higher nutritional value than other and some be better for build material and some be good for both um aspen tree. beaver peel off the bark to eat and they also use the branch for build they shelter. so aspen do double duty. but ash tree beaver use ash tree only for construction. another decision be when to forage for food. should they go out during the daytime when it be hotter outside and they have to expend more energy or at night when the weather be cooler but predator be more active. ok but there be two more important issue really the most central the most important ok. first let 's say a beaver could get the same amount of wood from a single large tree one that have lot of branch as it could get from three small tree. if it choose one large tree it will have to carry that large piece of wood back home and lug a big piece of wood 4 or 5 yard be hard work take a lot of energy. of course it will have to make only one trip to get the wood back to the water. on the other hand if it go for three small tree instead it will take less energy per tree to get the wood back home but it will have to make three trip back and forth for the three tree. and presumably the more often it wander from home the more it be likely to be expose to predator. so which be better a single large tree or three small tree. another critical issue and it be related to the first to the size issue be how far from the water should it go to get tree. should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree since it will get so much wood from it. beaver certainly go farther from the water to get a aspen tree than for a ash tree. that reflect they relative value. will it travel farther for a larger tree than it will for a smaller tree. now i would have think the bigger thetree the farther the beaver would be willing to travel for it. that would make sense right. if you be go to travel far make the trip worth it buy bring back most wood possible. but actually the opposite be true. beaver will cut down only large tree that be close to the water. they will travel far only to cut down certain small tree that they can cut down quickly and drag back home quickly. generally the farther they go from the water the smaller the tree they will cut down. they be willing to make more trip to haul back less wood which carry a greater risk of be expose to predator. so it look as though beaver be less interested in minimize they exposure to predator and more interested in save energy when forage for wood which may also explain why beaver forage primarily during the evening. ok so why do they behavior indicate more of a concern with how much energy they expend than with be expose to predator. no one believe a beaver consciously weigh the pro and con of each of these element. the answer that some give be that they behavior have evolve over time. it be be shape by constraint over vast stretch of time all of which come down to the fact that the best foraging strategy for beaver be not the one that yield the most food or wood. it be the one that result in the most descendant the most offspring. so let 's discuss how this idea work.",

        "question": "what do calcite deposit from devil hole reveal", 
        "context": "ok so we have be talk about theory that deal with the effect of human activity on the climate. but today i would like to talk a little bit about other theory that can explain variation in climate. and one of the best know be call the milankovitch hypothesis. now what the milankovitch hypothesis be about. it say that variation in earth 's movement specifically in its orbit around the sun these variation lead to difference in the amount of solar energy that reach the earth. and it be these difference in the amount of energy that be reach earth from the sun it be what cause variation in earth 's climate. ok a lot of people think of earth 's orbit around the sun as be perfectly circular as smooth and as regular as say the way that hand move on a well make watch but it just do not work that way. you be probably aware that the earth 's orbit around the sun it be not shape like a perfect circle. it be more of a oval it be elliptical. but the shape of this orbit be not consistent it vary over time over a period of about a thousand year. sometimes it be a little more circular sometimes it be more elliptical. and when earth 's orbit be more elliptical earth be actually closer to the sun during part of the year. which make earth and in particular the northern hemisphere warmer. and why be that important. well because most of the planet 's glacier be in the northern hemisphere and if it get too warm then glacier will stop form. and we have already talk about how that affect earth 's overall temperature. the second movement involve in the hypothesis have to do with axial tilt. the tilt of earth 's axis that imaginery pole that run through the center of the earth. and depend on the angle it tilt at the season can be more or less severe. it make winter cooler and summer warmer or what some might say it be do now it make summer less hot and more importantly the winter less cold. which just like what i mention before can also stop prevent glacier from form or cause they to melt. there be a third movement the hypothesis cover call precession. precession basically be the change in the direction of earth 's axis of rotation. it will take i a million year to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession be quite complex. and all these detail be way beyond we scope. what be important for you to understand be that these three movement well they be cyclical and they work together to form to produce complex but regular variation in earth 's climate and lead to the growth or decline of glacier. now when milankovitch first propose this theory in the 192 's many of he colleague be skeptical. milankovitch do not have any proof. actually there would not be any evidence to support he hypothesis until the 197 's when oceanographer be able to drill deep into the seafloor and collect sample sample which be then analyze by geologist. and from these sample they be able to put together a history of ocean temperature go back hundred of thousand of year and this show that earth 's climate have change pretty much the way milankovitch 's hypothesis suggest it would. so this evidence be pretty strong support for the milankovitch hypothesis. and by the 198 's most people accept this theory. however in the late 198 's some scientist be explore devil 's hole which be basically a extensive water fill cave far from the ocean in nevada2western united state. over million of year groundwater leave deposit of a mineral on the rock within devil 's hole. and by study these clacite deposit we can determine the climate condition the temperature over the last half million year. well the devil 's hole finding contradict the one obtain during the 197 's so basically the question be be the age of one or both the sample be wrong or be scientist misunderstand the significance of the evidence. well in the 199 's a new study be do on the two sample. and the ocean floor sample be find to be correct as be the sample from devil 's hole. and now it be generally believe that the sample from devil 's hole correspond to variation in local climate in the western united state rather than global climate change.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what cause the snowshoe hare 's fur to begin turn white", 
        "context": "now jame you say you have be to the state of maine right. yeah actually i live in western maine until i be about sixteen. so why do not you tell everybody what be like there in the winter. well it be cold. and there be lot of snow you would not believe how much snow we actually i would. i do field research up there a couple of winter. and it really be a incredible environment. and to survive in that sort of environment animal have to adapt to evolve in response to they surroundings. as you recall a adaptation be any feature um physical or behavioral feature of a species that help it survive and reproduce. and in adapt to extreme climate like maine in the winter time animal can evolve in pretty interesting way. take for example the snowshoe hare. ok the snowshoe hare and of course that be h a r e like a rabbit. although i probably should mention that technically a hare be not exactly the same as a rabbit even though it be very similar. the primary difference be that a rabbit 's young be bear blind and without fur while a hare 's baby be bear with a full coat and able to see. now the snowshoe hare tell i what sort of adaptation do you think it have develop that help it survive the maine winter. i will give you a hint. food be not a issue. the hare actually have abundant food in the small twig it find. well i do not know. i mean i know we use to try to look for these rabbit eh hare when we go hike in the winter but it be often hard to find they in the snow. the major concern of the snowshoe hare in the winter be predator. and now that include human. so one of its adaptation be basically camouflage. in other word its coat its fur turn from brown in the summer to white in the winter which make it harder for the hare 's predator to see it against the white snow. yeah but i could swear i remember see rabbit in the snow a couple of time i mean hare that be brown. well you may very well have. timing be really important but the snowshoe hare do not always get it exactly right. its chance for survival be best if it turn white about the time of the first snowfall. and it be the amount of daylight that trigger the change of the hare 's coat. as the day get shorter that be as the sun be up for a shorter and shorter time each day the snowshoe hare start grow white fur and shed its brown fur. the hare do a pretty good job with its timing but sometimes when there be a really early or late snow it stand out. plus it take about a month for the snowshoe hare 's coat to completely change color. so if there be a particularly early snowfall it be very likely that the hare 's fur would not yet be totally white. and that would make this a particularly dangerous time for the hare. well it be call the snowshoe hare so be its foot somehow protect it from the cold. well this animal 's name do have to do with a adaptation of its foot. uh though not like it have warm furry boot or something to keep its foot from get cold. you have probably never need to wear snowshoe. but well snowshoe be not like thick furry shoe design to keep the foot warm they be actually quite thin but very wide. what they do be spread out the weight of the foot come down on the snow. see the problem with walk on snow be that you sink in with every step. but with snowshoe you do not sink in you walk on top of the snow. it make walk through the maine countryside in the winter much easier. anyway the snowshoe hare have a adaptation that play on the same idea. it have hind foot that act like snowshoe. i mean it be paw be wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow. and this be a huge advantage for the snowshoe hare since by contrast the foot of its predator usually sink right down into the snow. now another advantage related to this be that unlike many animal in winter snowshoe hare can stay lean and light weight. they accumulate essentially no body fat. can anyone guess why this be so. they do not eat very much. but not because there be not enough food around. it be because like i say food be almost always within reach and they do not have to store up a lot of food energy for the harsh winter.",

        "question": "why do the ancient greek hold the geocentric view of the universe", 
        "context": "ok we have be talk about how throughout history it be often difficult for people to give up idea which have long be take for grant as scientific truth even if those idea be false. in astronomy for example the distinction between the solar system and the universe be not clear until modern time. the ancient greek believe that what we call the solar system be in fact the entire universe and that the universe be geocentric. geocentric means earth centered so the geocentric view hold that the sun the planet and the star all revolve around the earth which be stationary. of course we now know that the planet include earth revolve around the sun and that the solar system be only a tiny part of the universe. so why do the ancient greek believe that the earth be the center of the universe. well it make sense to they. observation of the sky make it appear as if the sun the moon and the star all revolve around the earth everyday while the earth itself stay in one place. and this view be also support by they philosophical and religious belief about the origin and structure of the universe. it be present in the work of well know greek philosopher as early as the fourth century b. and the geocentric theory continue to prevail in western thought for almost 2 year until the 17th century. now what be especially interesting be that when astronomical observation be make that seem to be inconsistent with the geocentric view the ancient greek do not really consider alternative theory. it be so intuitive so sensible that the earth be the center of the universe that astronomer find way to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomenon within the geocentric view. for example greek astronomer make excellent very accurate observation of the movement of the planet but the observation reveal a bit of a problem. the geocentric theory say that the planet would move around the earth in one direction. however astronomer notice that at time several planet seem to stop move in one direction and start move backward in they orbit around the earth and they come up with a theory that these planet themselves move in smaller circle call epicycle as they travel around the earth. here be a picture of what they imagine. you see how this epicycle theory could account for the seemingly backward motion of the planet. of course today we know that this appearance of backward motion be cause by the fact that earth as well as other planet all move in they own orbit around the sun and the relative movement of the planet with respect to each other can get quite complex. however there be a few astronomer in greece and other place who do not agree with the geocentric view for example a greek astronomer who live in the third century b. he propose the theory that we planetary system might be heliocentric he name be aristarchus. heliocentric means sun centered that the earth revolve around the sun. aristarchus recognize from he calculation that the sun be much larger than the earth and other planet. it be probably this discovery that lead he to conclude that the universe be heliocentric. i mean be not it more sensible to think that a smaller heavenly body would orbit a larger one rather than the opposite. however he proposition be reject largely base on other scientific belief hold at the time which all make sense in a way even if they be incorrect. let i mention two objection greek make to aristarchus 's theory. first they believe that everything that move create its own wind so to speak everyone have this experience when you be run right. so they think that if the earth itself be move there would have to be a constant wind blowing sweep they off they foot and of course there be not. and second the idea of a earth that move do not fit in with the ancient greek understanding of gravity. they think that gravity be basically a natural tendency of all thing to move towards the center of the universe which be the earth or the center of the earth so that explain why apple and other fall object be fall straight down. if the sun be at the center of the universe thing would fall toward the sun and away from the earth which of course they do not. so these be some of the reason they reject the heliocentric theory.",

        "context": "in order to really study the social history of the middle age you have to understand the role of spice. now this might sound a little spur even a little strange. but what seem like little thing now be back then actually rather big thing. so first let 's define what a spice be. technically speak a spice be part of a aromatic plant that be not a leaf or herb. spice can come from tree bark like cinnamon plant root like ginger flower bud like clove. and in the middle age. european be familiar with lot of different spice most important be pepper clove ginger cinnamon maize and nutmeg. these spice literarily dominate the way european live for century how they trade and even how they use they imagination. so why this medieval fascination with spice. we can boil it down to there general idea briefly. one be cost and rarity. uh two be exotic taste and fragrance. and third mysterious origin and kind of mythical status. now for cost and rarity spice be not native to europe and they have to be import. spice only grow in the east indy and of course transportation cost be incredibly valuable even from the very beginning. in 4 8 ad the gothic general who capture rome demand payment. he want 5 pound of gold among other thing but he also want 3 pound of pepper. maybe that would give you a idea of exactly where pepper stand at the time. by the middle age spice be regard as so important and expensive they be use in diplomacy as gift by head of state and ambassador. the diet then be relatively bland compare to today 's. there be not much variety. especially the aristocracy who tend to eat a lot of meat they be always look for new way to prepare it new source new taste and this be where spice come in. now this be a good point to mention one of the biggest myth about spice. it be commonly say that medieval european want spice to cover up the taste of spoil meat. but this be not really true. anyone who have to worry about spoil meat could not afford spice in the first place. if you could afford spice you could definitely afford fresh meat. we also have evidence that various medieval market employ a kind of police to make sure that people do not sell spoil food and if you be catch do it you be subject to various fine humiliating public punishment. so what actually be true be this in order to have meat for the winter people would preserve it in salt not a spice. spice actually be not very effective as preservative. and throughout winter they would eat salted meat but the taste of the stuff could grow really boring and depressing after a while. so the cook start look for new way to improve the taste and spice be the answer which bring we to mysterious origin and mythical status. now the ancient roman have a thriving spice trade and they send they ship to the east and back. but when rome collapse in the fifth century and the middle age begin direct trade stop and so do that kind of hand on knowledge of travel and geography. spice now come by way of the trade route with lot of intermediary between the producer and the consumer. so these spice take on a air of mystery. they origin be shroud in exotic travels. they have the allure of the unknown of wild place. myth grow up of fantasy land magical faraway place make entirely of food and spice. and to that spice themselves have always be consider special or magical not just for eat and this be already true in the ancient world where legend about spice be abundant. spice inspire the medieval imagination. they be use as medicine to ward off disease and mixed into perfume incent. they be use in religious ritual for thousand of year. they take on a life of they own and they inspire the medieval imagination spur on the age of discovery in the 145th and 16th century. when famous explorer like columbus and da gama and magellan leave europe in they ship they be not look for a new world. they be look for spice. and we know what important historical repercussion some of those voyage have.",

        "context": "when land get develop for human use the landscape change. we do not see as many type of vegetation tree grass and so forth. this in turn lead to other loss the loss of animal that once live there. err but these be the obvious change but there be also less obvious change like the climate. one interesting case of this uh of change in the local land use cause change in climate specifically the temperature be in florida. now what come to mind when you think of the state of florida. florida have long have a great citrus industry large growth of orange lemon and the like. florida 's winter be very mild the temperature do not often get below freezing. but there be some area of florida that do freeze. so in the early 19 's farmer move even further south in florida to area that be even less likely to freeze. obviously freezing temperature be a danger to the crop. a bad bout of cold weather a long spell of frost could ruin a farmer 's entire crop anyway before the citrus grower move south much of the land in south florida be what we call wetland. wetland be area of marshy swampy land area where water cover the soil or be present either at or near the surface of the soil for a large part of the year. wetland have they own unique ecosystem with plant and animal with special and interesting adaptation. very exciting but it be not what we be talk about today. but the land be not suitable for farm. you can not grow orange in wetland so farmer have to transform the wetland into land suitable for farm. to do that you have to drain the water from the land move the water elsewhere and divert the water source such as river. hundred of mile of drainage canal be build in the wetland. now these area the new area the farmer move to use to be warm and unlikely to freeze however recently the area have become susceptible to freeze. and we be try to understand why. be it some global temperature change or weather pattern like el ni o or something. well there be two theory. one idea be as you suggest that major weather pattern something like el ni o be responsible. but the other idea and this be the one that i personally subscribe to be that the change in the temperature pattern have be bring about by the loss of the wetland. well how would loss of wetland make a difference. well think about what we have be study so far. we have discuss the impact of landscape on temperature right. what effect do a body of water have on a area. body of water tend to absorb the heat during the day and then they release the heat at night. what you just say be what i want you all to understand. body of water release heat and moisture back into the environment. so place near large body of water be generally milder err slightly warmer than those without water. and what i and other think be that the loss of the wetland have create a situation where the local temperature in the area be now slightly different slightly colder than they be 1 year ago before the wetland be drain. hmm do we know what the temperature be like back then. well we be able to estimate this. we have datum about south florida 's current landscape uh the plant cover. and we be able to reconstruct datum about its landscape prior to 19. then we enter those datum information about what the landscape look like before and after the wetland be drain. we enter the datum into a computer weather model. this model can predict temperature. and when all of the datum be enter a overall cooling trend be predict by the model. how much colder do it get now. well actually the model show a drop of only a few degree celsius. but this be enough to cause dramatic damage to crop. if temperature overnight be already very close to the freezing point then this drop of just a few degree can take the temperature below freezing. and freezing cause frost which kill crop. these damaging frost would not happen if the wetland be still in existence just a tiny temperature difference can have major consequence.",

        "context": "ok as we have talk about a key aspect of run a successful business be know um get a good sense of what the customer actually want and how they perceive you product. so with that in mind i want to describe a very simple method of research customer preference and it be become increasingly common it be call mbwa which stand for manage by wander around. now mbwa that be not the most technical sound name you have ever hear but it describe the process pretty accurately. here be how it work. basically um the idea be that business owner or business manager just go out and actually talk to they customer and learn more about how well the business be serve they need and try to see what the customer experience because that be a great way to discover for yourself how you product be perceive what its strength and weakness be you know how you can improve it that sort of thing. you know dortan they make soup and can vegetable and such. well the head of the company have dortan top executive walk around supermarket um ask shopper what they think of dortan soup and he use that datum to make change to the company 's product i mean when dortan of all the company embrace something as radical as mbwa it really show you how popular the theory have become yes lisa. but be not it dangerous to base decision on information from a small sample of people. be not large scale market research safer get datum on a lot of people. that be a good question and well i do not want to pretend that w mbwa be some sort of um replacement for other method of customer research. now market research datum definitely can give you a good idea of um of the big picture but mbwa be really useful it kind of fill in the blank you know get a good underground sense of how you product be use and how people need to respond to they and yes the number of opinion you get be small so you do need to be careful but good business manager will tell you that the big fear they have and. and one of the most frequent problem they come across be well become out of touch with what they customer really want and need you know survey and market research stuff like that they can only tell you so much about what the customer actually want in they day to day life. manage by wander around on the other hand well that get you in there and give you a good sense of what customer need. so so when use combination then mbwa and market research well they be powerful tool. oh here be another example for you uh senior executive for a clothing manufacturer. it be um lken lken jeans you know they go and work in a store for a few day sell lken 's cloth. now that give they a very different idea about they product they see how people respond to it they could go up to customer in the store and ask they question about it uh yes mike. well i would think that a lot of customer would be bother by you know if i be shopping i do not know if i would want some business representative come up to i and ask i question it be it be like when i get phone call at home from market researcher i just hang up on they professor oh well it be certainly true that well no one like get call at home from market researcher or people like that but i will tell you something. most customer have the exact opposite reaction when it come to mbwa. now do not ask i why because i really have no idea but the fact be that customer tend to respond really well to mbwa which be the key reason for its success. in fact the technique of mbwa work so well they have actually be extend to all kind of different context like politics for instance um a few year back the mayor of baltimore um i think he name be sheaffer or something like that. anyway he decide that the best way to serve the people of the city of he city be to actually get out there in it and experience the thing that they experience so he would ride around the city in well you know in all part of it and he would see all the pothole he would see how the trash be sometimes um not pick up off the side of the street and then he would go back to he office and he would write these memo now they be memo to he staff about the problem he have see and how they need to be fix you know that sort of thing but the thing be he get all this information just by go around and see the different baltimore neighborhood and talk to the people in they. now he call it smart politics we would call it mbwa or just play good customer service.",

        "question": "what be the lecture mainly about", 
        "context": "since we be go to talk about change in animal population in the wild i would like to ask about somethingus read in a article online about how the population size of some animal species can affect other animal species and how other environmental factor come into play too. relationship between animal species in a give ecosystem can get pretty complex. because in addition to predator prey relationship there be other variable that affect population size. the article mention that population of predator and they prey might go up rapidly and then decline all of a sudden. i read about that in my ecology class. i think that be call a boom and bust cycle. well hold on a second. first i want to go over some key concept. let 's say there be a species that have access to plenty of food and ideal condition. under those circumstance its population would increase exponentially mean it would increase at a ever accelerate pace. that sound a little scary. well it do not usually happen. like you say a rapid population growth be often follow by a sudden decline. but we do occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative species when they be transplant into a new environment. um because they face little competition and have favorable grow condition. but for most species most of the time resource be finite. there be only so much available which lead i to my point. every ecosystem have what we call a carry capacity. the carry capacity be the maximum population size of a species that can be sustain by the resource of a particular ecosystem. resource be of course food water and just as important space. although every species have a maximum rate at which the population of that species could increase assume ideal condition for the species in its environment. there be always go to be environmental factor that limit population growth. this be call environmental resistance. environmental resistance be important becauseit stop population from grow out of control. factor such food supply predation and disease affect population size and can change from year to year or season to season. i think i get it. well let 's look at a case study. that should make thing clear. some year ago some of my colleague conduct a experiment in a oak forest involve three different species white footed mouse gypsy moth and oak tree. the above text be a transcript of this lecture prepare by lady bird qq519626928. now let i explain what the situation be in this forest. oak tree produce acorn and acorn be a primary food source for white footed mouse. another food source for the white footed mouse be the gypsy moth. so the size of the gypsy moth population be control by the white footed mouse which be a good thing because gypsy moth caterpillar be consider pest. they strip away the leaf from the oak tree every ten year or so. so the mouse eat both acorn from the oak tree and gypsy moth. and the gypsy moth caterpillar eat oak tree leave. now what make this set of relationship particularly interesting be that oak tree only produce a large number of acorn every few year. so during the year with fewer acorn the white footed mouse have to deal with a smaller food supply. but in the year with large amount of acorn the mouse have more food which lead to. the white footed mouse population grow. and the gypsy moth population decrease. how can we know that for sure. it seem like a big jump from more acorn to fewer gypsy moth. well we can know for sure because in this oak forest the researcher decide to test the link between acorn and the two animal species. in some part of the forest they have volunteer drop a large number of extra acorn on the forest floor. and in another section of the forest they remove a number of white footed mouse. in the forest area where extra acorn have be drop the gypsy moth population soon go into a significant decline. but in the section of the forest where the white footed mouse have be remove the gypsy moth population explode.",

        "context": "last time we start to talk about glacier and how these mass of ice form from crystallize snow and some of you be amaze at how huge some of these glacier be. now even though it may be difficult to understand how a huge mass of ice can move or flow it be another word for it it be really know that no secret that the glacier flow because of gravity. but how they flow the way they flow need some explain. now the first type of glacier flow be call basal slip. basal slip or slide as it be often call basically refer to the slip or slide of a glacier across bedrock actually across a thin layer of water on top of the bedrock. so this process should not be too hard to imagine. what happen be that the ice at the base of the glacier be under a great deal of pressure the pressure come from the weight of the overlie ice. and you probably know that under pressure the melting temperature of water of the ice i mean be reduce. so ice at the base of the glacier melt even though it be below zero degree celsius. and this result in a thin layer of water between the glacier and the ground. this layer of water reduce friction be be like a lubricant. and it allow the glacier to slide or slip over the bedrock. now the next type of movement we will talk about be call deformation. you v already know that ice be brittle if you hit it with a hammer it will shatter like glass. but ice be also plastic it can change shape without break. if you leave for example a bar of ice support only at one end the end the unsupported end will deform under its own weight it will kind of flatten out at one end get distort deform. think of deformation as a very slow ooze. depend on the stress on the glacier the ice crystal within it reorganize. and during this re organization the ice crystal realign in a way that allow they to slide pass each other. and so the glacier ooze downhill without any ice actually melting. now there be a couple of factor that affect the amount of deformation that take place or the speed of the glacier 's movement for example. deformation be more likely to occur the thicker the ice be because of the gravity of the weight of the ice. and temperature also play a part here in that cold ice do not move as easily as ice that be close to the melting point in fact it be not too different from the way oil be thicker at lower temperature. so if you have a glacier in a slightly warmer region it will flow faster than a glacier in a cooler region. ok um now i would like to touch briefly on extension and compression. you textbook include these as type as a particular type of glacier movement but you will see that there be as many textbook that omit it as a type of movement as include it. and i might not include it right now if it be not in you textbook. but basically the upper part of glacier have less pressure on they. so they do not deform easily they tend to be more brittle. and crevasse can form in this upper layer of the glacier. when the glacier come into contact with bedrock wall or be otherwise under some kind of stress but can not deform quickly enough. so the ice would expand or constrict and that can cause big fissure big crack to form in the surface layer of the ice and that brittle surface ice move be sometimes consider a type of glacier movement depend on which source you be consult. now as you probably know glacier generally move really slowly. but sometimes they experience surge and during these surge in some place they can move at speed as high as 7 meter per year. now speed like that be pretty unusual hundred of time faster than the regular movement of glacier but you can actually see glacier move during these surge though it be rare.",

        "context": "another ancient greek philosopher we need to discuss be aristotle aristotle 's ethical theory. what aristotle 's ethical theory be all about be this he be try to show you how to be happy what true happiness be. now why be he interested in human happiness. it be not just because it be something that all people want to aim for. it be more than that. but to get there we need to first make a very important distinction. let i introduce a couple of technical term extrinsic value and intrinsic value. to understand aristotle 's interest in happiness you need to understand this distinction. some thing we aim for and value not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves. if i value something as a means to something else then it have what we will call extrinsic value. other thing we desire and hold to be valuable for themselves alone. if we value something not as a means to something else but for its own sake let we say that it have intrinsic value. there may be some people who value exercise for itself but i do not. i value exercise because if i exercise i tend to stay healthier than i would if i do not. so i desire to engage in exercise and i value exercise extrinsically. not for its own sake but as a means to something beyond it. it bring i good health. why do i value good health. well here it get a little more complicate for i. um health be important for i because i can not. do other thing i want to do play music teach philosophy if i be ill. so health be important to i have value to i as a means to a productive life. but health be also important to i because i just kind of like to be healthy it feel good. it be pleasant to be healthy unpleasant not to be. so to some degree i value health both for itself and as a means to something else productivity. it be get extrinsic and intrinsic value for i. then there be some thing that be just value for themselves. i be a musician not a professional musician i just play a musical instrument for fun. why do i value playing music. well like most amateur musician i only play because well i just enjoy it. it be something that be a end in itself. now something else i value be teaching. well it bring in a modest income but i could make more money do other thing. i would do it even if they do not pay i. in that sense it be a end to itself. but teaching 's not something that have intrinsic value for all people and that be true generally. most thing that be enjoy in and of themselves vary from person to person. some people value teaching intrinsically but other do not. so how do all this relate to human happiness. well aristotle ask be there something that all human being value. and value only intrinsically for its own sake and only for its own sake. if you could find such a thing that would be the universal final good or truly the ultimate purpose or goal for all human being. aristotle think the answer be yes. everyone will agree he argue that happiness be the ultimate end to be value for itself and really only for itself. for what other purpose be there in be happy. the attainment of happiness become the ultimate or highest good for aristotle. the next question that aristotle raise be what be happiness. we all want it we all desire it we all seek it. it be the goal we have in life. how do we find it. here he note with some frustration people disagree. but he do give we a couple of criterion or feature to keep in mind as we look for what true human happiness be. true human happiness should be as he put it complete. complete in that it be all we require. well true human happiness. if you have that what else do you need. and second true happiness should be something that i can obtain on my own. i should not have to rely on other people for it. many people value fame and seek fame. fame for they become the goal. but accord to aristotle this will not work either because fame depend altogether too much on other people. i can not get it on my own without help from other people. in the end aristotle say that true happiness be the exercise of reason a life of intellectual contemplation. so let 's see how he come to that.",

        "context": "now astronomy do not really bloom into the science it be today until the development of spectroscopy. spectroscopy be basically the study of spectrum and spectral line of light and specifically for we the light from star. it make it possible to analyze the light emit from star. when you analyze this light you can figure out they distance from the earth and identify what they be make of determine they chemical composition. before we get into that though it be probably a good thing to back up a bit. you all know how when you take a crystal prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it you get a spectrum which look like a continuous band of rainbow color. the light that we see with we human eye as a band of rainbow color fall in the range of what be call visible light. and visible light spectroscopy be probably the most important kind of spectroscopy. anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light. and i be sure all of you know this because you all do the reading for today. but i think be expose to radiation be dangerous. if you be talk about radiation like in the element uranium yeah that be dangerous. but radiation as a general term actually refer to anything that spread away from its source. so optical radiation be just visible light energy spread out. ok so we have get a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it look like the color bleed into each other. there be no interruption just a band flow from violet to green to yellow to you get the idea. well what happen if the sunlight 's spectrum be magnify. maybe you all do not do the reading. well here be what you would see. i want you to notice that this spectrum be interrupt by dark line call spectral line. if you really magnify the spectrum of the sunlight you could identify more than 1 of they. they may look like kind of randomly place but they actually form many distinct pattern. and if you be look at the spectrum of some other star the color would be the same. but the spectral line would break it up at different place make different pattern. each pattern stand for a distinct chemical element and so different set or pattern of spectral line mean that the star have a different chemical composition. so how do we know which spectral pattern match up with which element. well a kind of spectroscopic library of element be compile use flame test. a known element say a piece of iron for example be heat in a pure gas flame. the iron eventually heat to the point that it radiate light. this light be pass through a prism which break it up into a spectrum. and a unique pattern kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral line for that element appear. this process be repeat over and over again for many different element so we can figure out the chemical makeup of another star by compare the spectral pattern it have to the pattern of the element in the library. oh a interesting story about how one of the element be discover through spectroscopy. there be a pretty extensive library of spectral line pattern of element even by the 186 's. a british astronomer be analyze a spectrograph of sunlight and he notice a particular pattern of spectral line that do not match anything in the library. so he put two and two together and decide there be a element in the sun that have not be discover here on the earth yet. any guess about what that element be. it actually turn out to be pretty common and i be sure all of you know it. let 's try something else. any of you happen to be familiar with the greek word for sun by chance. something like helius or something like that. oh it must be helium. so you be say that helium be discover on the sun first. yes and this be a good example of how important spectroscopy be in astronomy.",

        "context": "let 's continue we discussion about animal behavior by talk about decision that animal face complex one. animal even insect carry out what look like very complex decision make process. i mean no one really think that say a bee go through weigh the pro and con of pollinate this flower or that flower. but then how do animal solve complex question question that seem to require decision making. the answer we will propose of course be that they behavior be largely a matter of natural selection. as a example let 's look at forage behavior among beaver. beaver eat plant mostly tree. and they also use tree and tree branch to construct they home in stream and lake. so when they do forage for food and for shelter material they have to leave they home and go up on land where they main predator be. so there be a number of choice that have to be make about forage. so for example um they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down. some tree have higher nutritional value than other and some be better for build material and some be good for both um aspen tree. beaver peel off the bark to eat and they also use the branch for build they shelter. so aspen do double duty. but ash tree beaver use ash tree only for construction. another decision be when to forage for food. should they go out during the daytime when it be hotter outside and they have to expend more energy or at night when the weather be cooler but predator be more active. ok but there be two more important issue really the most central the most important ok. first let 's say a beaver could get the same amount of wood from a single large tree one that have lot of branch as it could get from three small tree. if it choose one large tree it will have to carry that large piece of wood back home and lug a big piece of wood 4 or 5 yard be hard work take a lot of energy. of course it will have to make only one trip to get the wood back to the water. on the other hand if it go for three small tree instead it will take less energy per tree to get the wood back home but it will have to make three trip back and forth for the three tree. and presumably the more often it wander from home the more it be likely to be expose to predator. so which be better a single large tree or three small tree. another critical issue and it be related to the first to the size issue be how far from the water should it go to get tree. should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree since it will get so much wood from it. beaver certainly go farther from the water to get a aspen tree than for a ash tree. that reflect they relative value. will it travel farther for a larger tree than it will for a smaller tree. now i would have think the bigger thetree the farther the beaver would be willing to travel for it. that would make sense right. if you be go to travel far make the trip worth it buy bring back most wood possible. but actually the opposite be true. beaver will cut down only large tree that be close to the water. they will travel far only to cut down certain small tree that they can cut down quickly and drag back home quickly. generally the farther they go from the water the smaller the tree they will cut down. they be willing to make more trip to haul back less wood which carry a greater risk of be expose to predator. so it look as though beaver be less interested in minimize they exposure to predator and more interested in save energy when forage for wood which may also explain why beaver forage primarily during the evening. ok so why do they behavior indicate more of a concern with how much energy they expend than with be expose to predator. no one believe a beaver consciously weigh the pro and con of each of these element. the answer that some give be that they behavior have evolve over time. it be be shape by constraint over vast stretch of time all of which come down to the fact that the best foraging strategy for beaver be not the one that yield the most food or wood. it be the one that result in the most descendant the most offspring. so let 's discuss how this idea work.",

        "context": "good morning ready to continue we review of prehistoric art. today we will be cover the upper paleolithic period which i be roughly define as the period from 35 to 8 bc. a lot of those cave drawing you have all see come from this period. but we be also be talk about portable work of art thing that could be carry around from place to place. this sculpture be call the lady with the hood1 and it be carve from ivory probably a mammoth 's tusk. its age be a bit of a mystery. accord to one source it date from 22 bc. but other source claim it have be date closer to 3 bc. why do not we know the exact date when this head be make. that be a fair question. we be talk about prehistory here. so obviously the artist do not put a signature or a date on anything they do. so how do we know when this figure be carve. last semester i take a archaeology class and we spend a lot time on study way to date thing. one technique i remember be use the location of a object to date it like how deep it be bury. stratigraphy be use for date portable art. when archaeologist be digging at a site they make very careful note about which stratum strata which layer of earth they find thing in. and you know the general rule be that the oldest layer be at the lowest level. but this only work if the site have not be touch and the layer be intact. a problem with this date method be that a object could have be carry around use for several generation before it be discard. so it might be much older than the layer or even the site where it be find. the stratification technique give we the minimum age of a object which be not necessarilly its true age. tom in you archaeology class do you talk about radiocarbon date. that have to do with chemical analysis something to do with measure the amount of radiocarbon that be leave in organic stuff. because we know how fast radiocarbon decay we can figure out the age of the organic material. the key word there be organic. be art make of organic material. well you say the lady with the hood be carve out of ivory. well when they do those cave drawing. do not they use like chacoal or maybe color dye make from plant. fortunately they do at least some of the time. so it turn out that radiocarbon date work for a lot of prehistoric art. but again there be a problem. this technique destroy what it analyze so you have to chip off bit of the object for testing. obviously we be reluctant to do that in some case. and apart from that there be another problem. the date tell you the age of the material say a bone or a tree the object be make from but not the date when the artist actually create it. so with radiocarbon date we get the maximum possible age for the object but it could be younger. ok let 's say we scientific analysis have produce a age range. can we narrow itcould we look for similar style or motive. you know try to find thing common to one time period. we do that all the time. and when we see similarity in piece of art we assume some connection in time or place. but be it possible that we could be impose we own value on that analysis. i do not get you point. well we have all kind of pre conceive idea about how artistic style develop. for example a lot of people think the presence of detail demonstrate that the work be do by a more sophisticated artist. while a lack of detail suggest a primitive style. but trend in art in the last century or so certainly challenge that idea. do not get i wrong though analyze the style of prehistoric art can help date they. but we need to be careful with the idea that artistic development occur in a straight line from simple to complex representation. what you be say be i mean i get the feeling that this be like a legal process like build a legal case the more piece of evidence we have the closer we get to the truth. and now you can see why we do not have a exact date for we sculpture the lady with the hood.",

        "context": "ok so we have be talk about theory that deal with the effect of human activity on the climate. but today i would like to talk a little bit about other theory that can explain variation in climate. and one of the best know be call the milankovitch hypothesis. now what the milankovitch hypothesis be about. it say that variation in earth 's movement specifically in its orbit around the sun these variation lead to difference in the amount of solar energy that reach the earth. and it be these difference in the amount of energy that be reach earth from the sun it be what cause variation in earth 's climate. ok a lot of people think of earth 's orbit around the sun as be perfectly circular as smooth and as regular as say the way that hand move on a well make watch but it just do not work that way. you be probably aware that the earth 's orbit around the sun it be not shape like a perfect circle. it be more of a oval it be elliptical. but the shape of this orbit be not consistent it vary over time over a period of about a thousand year. sometimes it be a little more circular sometimes it be more elliptical. and when earth 's orbit be more elliptical earth be actually closer to the sun during part of the year. which make earth and in particular the northern hemisphere warmer. and why be that important. well because most of the planet 's glacier be in the northern hemisphere and if it get too warm then glacier will stop form. and we have already talk about how that affect earth 's overall temperature. the second movement involve in the hypothesis have to do with axial tilt. the tilt of earth 's axis that imaginery pole that run through the center of the earth. and depend on the angle it tilt at the season can be more or less severe. it make winter cooler and summer warmer or what some might say it be do now it make summer less hot and more importantly the winter less cold. which just like what i mention before can also stop prevent glacier from form or cause they to melt. there be a third movement the hypothesis cover call precession. precession basically be the change in the direction of earth 's axis of rotation. it will take i a million year to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession be quite complex. and all these detail be way beyond we scope. what be important for you to understand be that these three movement well they be cyclical and they work together to form to produce complex but regular variation in earth 's climate and lead to the growth or decline of glacier. now when milankovitch first propose this theory in the 192 's many of he colleague be skeptical. milankovitch do not have any proof. actually there would not be any evidence to support he hypothesis until the 197 's when oceanographer be able to drill deep into the seafloor and collect sample sample which be then analyze by geologist. and from these sample they be able to put together a history of ocean temperature go back hundred of thousand of year and this show that earth 's climate have change pretty much the way milankovitch 's hypothesis suggest it would. so this evidence be pretty strong support for the milankovitch hypothesis. and by the 198 's most people accept this theory. however in the late 198 's some scientist be explore devil 's hole which be basically a extensive water fill cave far from the ocean in nevada2western united state. over million of year groundwater leave deposit of a mineral on the rock within devil 's hole. and by study these clacite deposit we can determine the climate condition the temperature over the last half million year. well the devil 's hole finding contradict the one obtain during the 197 's so basically the question be be the age of one or both the sample be wrong or be scientist misunderstand the significance of the evidence. well in the 199 's a new study be do on the two sample. and the ocean floor sample be find to be correct as be the sample from devil 's hole. and now it be generally believe that the sample from devil 's hole correspond to variation in local climate in the western united state rather than global climate change.",

        "context": "so would it surprise you to learn that many of the food that we today consider traditional european dish that they key ingredient be not even know in europe until quite recently until the european start trade with the native people of north and south america. i mean you be probably aware that the america provide europe and asia with food like squash bean turkey peanut. but what about all those italian tomato sauce hungarian goulash or my favorite french fries. i mean i know potato be from where south america. right the ande mountain. but you be say tomato too. i just assume since they be use in so many italian dish. no like potato tomato grow wild in the ande. although unlike potato they be not originally cultivate there. that seem to have occur first in central america. and even then the tomato do not appear to have be very important as a food plant until the european come on the scene. they take it back to europe with they around 155. and italy be indeed the first place where it be widely grow as a food crop. so in a sense it really be more italian than american. and another thing and this be true of both potato and tomato. both of these plant be member of the nightshade family. the nightshade family be a category of plant which also include many that you would not want to eat like mandrake belladonna and even tobacco. so it be no wonder that people once consider potato and tomato to be inedible too even poisonous. and in fact the leaf of the potato plant be quite toxic. so it take both plant quite a while to catch on in europe. and even longer before they make the return trip to north america and become popular food item here. yeah you know i remember i remember my grandmother tell i that when she mother be a little girl a lot of people still think that tomato be poisonous. people do not really start eat they here until the mid eighteen hundred. but seem like i hear do not thoma jefferson grow they or something. well that be true. but then jefferson be know not only as the third president of the united state but also as a scholar who be way ahead of he time in many way. he do not let the conventional thinking of he day restrain he idea. now potato go through a similar sort of uh of a rejection process especially when they be first introduce in europe. you know how potato can turn green if they be leave in the light too long. and that greenish skin can make the potato taste bitter even make you ill. so that be enough to put people off for over 2 year. i be sorry professor jone. but i mean yeah ok. american crop have probably contribute a lot to european cooking over the year. but but have they really play any kind of important role in european history. well as a matter of fact yes. i be just come to that. let 's start with north american corn or maize as it be often call. now before the european make contact with the america they subsist mainly on grain grain that often suffer from crop failure. and largely for this reason that political power in europe be center for century in the south around the mediterranean sea which be where they could grow these grain with more reliability. when corn come to europe from mexico well now they have a much hardier crop that could be grow easily in more northerly climate and the center of power begin to shift accordingly. and then well as i say potato be not really popular at first. but when they finally do catch on which they do first in ireland around 178. well why do you suppose it happen. because potato have the ability to provide a abundant and extremely nutritious food crop no other crop grow in north europe at the time have anything like the number of vitamin contain in potato. plus potato grow on the single acre of land could feed many more people than say wheat grow on the same land. potato soon spread to france and other northern european country. and as a result the nutrition of the general population improve tremendously and population soar in the early 18 's and so the shift of power from southern to northern europe continue.",

        "context": "now we can not really talk about fairy tale without first talk about folktale because there be a strong connection between these two genre these two type of story. in fact many fairy tale start out as folktale. so what be a folktale. how would you characterize they. well they be old story traditional story. they be pass down orally within culture from generation to generation so they change a lot over time. i mean every storyteller or maybe every town might have have a slightly different version of the same folktale. and that be why we say folktale be communal. by communal we mean they reflect the trait and the concern of a particular community at a particular time. so essentially the same tale could be tell in different community with certain aspect of the tale adapt to fit the specific community. um not the plot the detail of what happen in the story would remain constant. that be the thread that hold the tale together. but all the other element like the location or character might be modify for each audience. so what about fairy tale. th they also be find in most culture but how be they different from folktale. i guess the first question be what be a fairy tale. and do not anyone say a story with a fairy in it because we all know that very few fairy tale actually have those tiny magical creature in they. but what else can we say about they. well they seem to be less realistic than folktale like they have something improbable happen a frog turn into a prince say. oh that be another common element royalty a prince or princess. and fairy tale all seem to take place in a location that be nowhere and everywhere at the same time. what be the line up. how do all those story start. once upon a time in a faraway land oh in the case of folktale each storyteller would specify a particular location and time though the time and location would differ for different storyteller. with fairy tale however the location be generally unspecified no matter who the storyteller be. that land far away we will come back to this point in a few minute. um i i think that a fairy tale be just a write version of a oral folktale. well not exactly though that be how many fairy tale develop. for example in the late 18th century the grimm brother travel throughout what be now germany record local folktale. these be eventually publish as fairy tale but not before undergo a process of evolution. now a number of thing happen when a oral tale get write down. first the language change. it become more formal more standard some might say less colorful. it be like the difference in you language depend on whether you be talk to someone or write they a letter. second when a orally transmit story be write down a authoritative version with a recognize author be create. the communal aspect get lose. the tale no longer belong to the community. it belong to the world so to speak. because of this element like place and time can no longer be tailor to suit a particular audience. so they become less identifiable more generalizable to any audience. on the other hand description of character and setting can be develop more completely. in folktale character might be identify by a name but you would not know anything more about they. but in fairy tale people no longer have to remember plot. they be write down right. so more energy can be put into other element of the story like character and setting. so you get more detail about the character about where the action take place what people 's house be like ur whether they be small cabin or grand palace. and it be worth invest that energy because the story now in book form be not in danger of be lose. those detail will not be forget. if a folktale be not repeat by each generation it may be lose for all time. but with a fairy tale it be always there in a book wait to be discover again and again. another interesting difference involve the change in audience. who the story be mean for. contrary to what many people believe today folktale be originally intend for adult not for child. so why be it that fairy tale seem target toward child nowadays.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what be plato 's attitude toward music", 
        "context": "today we be go to do something a little different. in the past few class we have listen to traditional music from around the world and we have talk about the characteristic of these music what make these style distinctive what kind of instrument be use. and you have talk about what sound familiar to you and what sound strange. and many of you find some of what we have listen to very strange indeed. well today i want to start talk about western music and i be go to start in ancient greece. but now here be the part that be different. we be not go to talk very much about the actual music. instead we be go to talk about what the greek believe about music. now there be some very good reason to approach the material in this way. first well we do not have very much ancient greek music study. only about 45 piece survive uh these be mostly record of poem and song. and we be not sure how well we can reproduce the melody or rhythm because they be apparently improvise in many case. so we really do not know all that much about what the music sound like. what we do know about and this really be the most important reason i be approach today 's lecture the way i be be the greek philosophy about music and its continuing influence on western attitude toward music. now if we be go to understand the philosophy we have to first understand that music for the greek be about much more than entertainment. yes there be music at festival and we have sculpture and painting show people listen to music for many of the same reason that we do. but this be not the whole story. the important thing about music be that it be govern by rule mathematical rule. and for those of you who be also study music theory you will see that it be in fact highly mathematical. um and for the greek the same mathematical principle that govern music also govern the universe as well as the human character the essence of personality. people 's character be believe to be very sensitive to music. if you start play around with the rule you know mess up the mathematical order you could do serious harm. that be why music be consider so powerful. if you know the rule it could do great good. but if you break they you could do great harm to the character of the listener. so we have this greek idea that music be directly related to human character and behavior. the philosopher plato talk about this in the context of education. for plato music be a important element in education but only the right kind of music. that mean the kind of music that build the kind of character a good citizen or a future leader would need. for plato there be a kind of music that instill the quality of leadership just as there be a kind of music that make a person soft and weak. now plato have very specific very conventional kind of music in mind. he be not fond of innovation. there be musician in plato 's day who be experiment with different melody and rhythm. a definite no no for plato. he think that break with tradition lead to all sort of social problem serious problem even the breakdown of the fabric of society. i be think back now to when i first start listen to rock n roll and i remember my father say it be a bad influence on we. i think he would have get along well with plato. anyway i do not need to tell you what i think about plato 's idea about innovation do i. though i have to say it be interesting that the same argument against new music and art be still be make. perhaps like the greek we recognize and maybe even fear the power of music.",

        "context": "we have be talk about the decline of coral reef in tropical area all over the world um how natural and man make stress be cause they to degrade and in some case to die. so now let 's focus on a specific example of a natural predator that can cause a lot of damage to coral reef the crown of thorn or cot starfish. the cot starfish be find on coral reef in the tropical pacific ocean and it eat coral. now in small number the starfish do not affect coral reef dramatically. but periodically starfish population explode. and when that happen the reef can become badly damage or even destroy something we be try very hard to prevent. for example during the 196 's there be a outbreak of cot starfish in the great barrier reef off the east coast of australia. luckily the cot starfish population gradually decline on its own and the reef recover. but we be leave wonder what cause the population to increase so suddenly. well over the year we have come up with a few hypothesis. one hypothesis be that it be a natural phenomenon that the starfish naturally undergo population fluctuation follow particularly good spawning year. there be also several hypothesis that suggest some sort of human activity be partly responsible like fishing. there be fish and snail that eat starfish particularly the giant triton snail which be the main predator of the starfish. these fish and snail have themselves experience a decline in population because of overfishing by human. so with a decline in starfish predator the starfish population can increase. another hypothesize human related cause be fertilizer runoff. people use fertilizer for they crop and plant and a lot of it eventually make its way from land into the sea. it be fertilizer so it have a lot of nutrient. these nutrient have a effect on the starfish because they cause a increase in the growth of phytoplankton. phytoplankton be microscopic plant that grow in the ocean. larval cot starfish eat phytoplankton in they first month of life so more fertilizer in the ocean mean more phytoplankton which mean more starfish bad for the reef. now the final hypothesis have to do with storm event. if some reef be destroy by storm starfish population that inhabit those reef would have to condense and concentrate on the reef that be leave. so this can cause a kind of mass feeding frenzy. so we have idea but no real answer. and because we be not sure of the cause for starfish population increase it be difficult to prevent they. i mean some progress have be make. for example new survey technique have enable we to detect population increase when the starfish be quite young so we can be ready for they. but meaningful progress require much better evidence about the cause. on the bright side in all the research be do on cause we have discover something related to how starfish population might affect coral reef diversity. we think that when reef be damage after a few year the fastest grow coral repopulate the area. and these fast grow species can grow over the slower grow species of coral deny they light and prevent they from recovery. however the faster grow species be the preferred food of the cot starfish. so when a outbreak of cot starfish occur they thin out the fast grow coral and may give the slower one a chance to reestablish. so without the outbreak the diversity of coral would be reduce.",

        "question": "what be the lecture mainly about", 
        "context": "now jame you say you have be to the state of maine right. yeah actually i live in western maine until i be about sixteen. so why do not you tell everybody what be like there in the winter. well it be cold. and there be lot of snow you would not believe how much snow we actually i would. i do field research up there a couple of winter. and it really be a incredible environment. and to survive in that sort of environment animal have to adapt to evolve in response to they surroundings. as you recall a adaptation be any feature um physical or behavioral feature of a species that help it survive and reproduce. and in adapt to extreme climate like maine in the winter time animal can evolve in pretty interesting way. take for example the snowshoe hare. ok the snowshoe hare and of course that be h a r e like a rabbit. although i probably should mention that technically a hare be not exactly the same as a rabbit even though it be very similar. the primary difference be that a rabbit 's young be bear blind and without fur while a hare 's baby be bear with a full coat and able to see. now the snowshoe hare tell i what sort of adaptation do you think it have develop that help it survive the maine winter. i will give you a hint. food be not a issue. the hare actually have abundant food in the small twig it find. well i do not know. i mean i know we use to try to look for these rabbit eh hare when we go hike in the winter but it be often hard to find they in the snow. the major concern of the snowshoe hare in the winter be predator. and now that include human. so one of its adaptation be basically camouflage. in other word its coat its fur turn from brown in the summer to white in the winter which make it harder for the hare 's predator to see it against the white snow. yeah but i could swear i remember see rabbit in the snow a couple of time i mean hare that be brown. well you may very well have. timing be really important but the snowshoe hare do not always get it exactly right. its chance for survival be best if it turn white about the time of the first snowfall. and it be the amount of daylight that trigger the change of the hare 's coat. as the day get shorter that be as the sun be up for a shorter and shorter time each day the snowshoe hare start grow white fur and shed its brown fur. the hare do a pretty good job with its timing but sometimes when there be a really early or late snow it stand out. plus it take about a month for the snowshoe hare 's coat to completely change color. so if there be a particularly early snowfall it be very likely that the hare 's fur would not yet be totally white. and that would make this a particularly dangerous time for the hare. well it be call the snowshoe hare so be its foot somehow protect it from the cold. well this animal 's name do have to do with a adaptation of its foot. uh though not like it have warm furry boot or something to keep its foot from get cold. you have probably never need to wear snowshoe. but well snowshoe be not like thick furry shoe design to keep the foot warm they be actually quite thin but very wide. what they do be spread out the weight of the foot come down on the snow. see the problem with walk on snow be that you sink in with every step. but with snowshoe you do not sink in you walk on top of the snow. it make walk through the maine countryside in the winter much easier. anyway the snowshoe hare have a adaptation that play on the same idea. it have hind foot that act like snowshoe. i mean it be paw be wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow. and this be a huge advantage for the snowshoe hare since by contrast the foot of its predator usually sink right down into the snow. now another advantage related to this be that unlike many animal in winter snowshoe hare can stay lean and light weight. they accumulate essentially no body fat. can anyone guess why this be so. they do not eat very much. but not because there be not enough food around. it be because like i say food be almost always within reach and they do not have to store up a lot of food energy for the harsh winter.",

        "question": "what be two point the professor make about the administrative calendar", 
        "context": "ok so one of the challenge that face ancient civilization like egypt be timekeep calendar. when you have to grow food for whole city of people it be important to plant you crop at the right time. and when you start have financial obligation rent tax you have to keep track of how often you pay. so today we will look at how the egyptian adress these problem. in fact they end up use two calendar one to keep track of the natural world or they agriculture concern and another one that be use to keep track of the business function of the kingdom. so let 's take a look at the how and why of one ancient egyptian calendar system start with the nile river. well there be no other way to put it. egyptian life basically revolve around the mysterious rise and fall of the river. the success of they agriculture system depend upon they know when the river would change. so naturally they first calendar be divide up into three season each base on the river 's change inundation subsidence and harvest. the first season be the flooding or inundation when the nile valley be essentially submerge in water for a few month or so. and afterwards during the season of subsidence the water would subside or recede reveal a new layer of fertile black silt and allow for the planting of various crop. and finally the time of the year would arrive when the valley would produce crop such as wheat barley fruit all ready to harvest. ok so it be important to the ancient egyptian to know when they nile based season would occur they way of life depend upon it. now the way they use to count time be base on the phase of the moon which regularly and predictably go through a cycle start with a new moon then to a full moon and back again to the new moon. now this cycle we then use to determine the length of they month. so um one lunar cycle be one egyptian month and about four of the month would constitute a season. now 12 of these month be a approximately 354 day year. so they have a 354 day agricultural calendar that be design to help they determine when the nile would inunadate the land. well of course it have to be more complicated than that. the average amount of time between flooding be not actually 354 day. i mean although it vary the average be clearly longer than 354 day. so how do they keep this short calendar in step with the actual flooding of the nile. well they astronomer have discover that at a certain time of year the brightest star sirius would disappear. actually it would be hide in the glare of the sun. and then a couple of month later one morning in the eartern sky just before dawn sirius would reappear. and it happen regularly about every 365 day. even more significantly the reappearance of sirius would occur around the same time as the nile 's flooding. and this annual event be call a heliacal rising4the heliacal rising be a fair indicator of when the nile would flood. the next new moon after the heliacal rising of sirius which happen in the last month of the calendar year mark the new year. and because the ancient egyptian be use the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising some year end up have 12 lunar month while other have 13 lunar calender month if sirius do not rise in the 12th month. even though the length of the agricultural calendar still fluctuate with some year have 12 month and other have 13 it end up be much more reliable than it be before. they continually adjust it to the heliacal rising of sirius ensure that they never get too far off in they season. this new calendar be ideal because well it work well for agricultural purpose as well as for know when to have traditional religious festival. so that be they first calendar. but be it any way to run a government. they do not think so. for administrative purpose it be very inconvenient to have year of different length. so another calendar be introduce a administrative one. probably soon after 3 bc they declare a 365 day year with 12 month per year with exactly 3 day each month with a extra 5 day at the end of each year. this administrative calendar exist alongside the earlier agricultural and religious calendar that depend on the heliacal rising of sirius. this administrative calendar be much easier to use for thing like scheduling tax and other thing that have to be pay on time. over time the calendar get out of step with season and the flooding of the nile but for bureaucratic purpose they do not mind.",

        "context": "ok so one of the challenge that face ancient civilization like egypt be timekeep calendar. when you have to grow food for whole city of people it be important to plant you crop at the right time. and when you start have financial obligation rent tax you have to keep track of how often you pay. so today we will look at how the egyptian adress these problem. in fact they end up use two calendar one to keep track of the natural world or they agriculture concern and another one that be use to keep track of the business function of the kingdom. so let 's take a look at the how and why of one ancient egyptian calendar system start with the nile river. well there be no other way to put it. egyptian life basically revolve around the mysterious rise and fall of the river. the success of they agriculture system depend upon they know when the river would change. so naturally they first calendar be divide up into three season each base on the river 's change inundation subsidence and harvest. the first season be the flooding or inundation when the nile valley be essentially submerge in water for a few month or so. and afterwards during the season of subsidence the water would subside or recede reveal a new layer of fertile black silt and allow for the planting of various crop. and finally the time of the year would arrive when the valley would produce crop such as wheat barley fruit all ready to harvest. ok so it be important to the ancient egyptian to know when they nile based season would occur they way of life depend upon it. now the way they use to count time be base on the phase of the moon which regularly and predictably go through a cycle start with a new moon then to a full moon and back again to the new moon. now this cycle we then use to determine the length of they month. so um one lunar cycle be one egyptian month and about four of the month would constitute a season. now 12 of these month be a approximately 354 day year. so they have a 354 day agricultural calendar that be design to help they determine when the nile would inunadate the land. well of course it have to be more complicated than that. the average amount of time between flooding be not actually 354 day. i mean although it vary the average be clearly longer than 354 day. so how do they keep this short calendar in step with the actual flooding of the nile. well they astronomer have discover that at a certain time of year the brightest star sirius would disappear. actually it would be hide in the glare of the sun. and then a couple of month later one morning in the eartern sky just before dawn sirius would reappear. and it happen regularly about every 365 day. even more significantly the reappearance of sirius would occur around the same time as the nile 's flooding. and this annual event be call a heliacal rising4the heliacal rising be a fair indicator of when the nile would flood. the next new moon after the heliacal rising of sirius which happen in the last month of the calendar year mark the new year. and because the ancient egyptian be use the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising some year end up have 12 lunar month while other have 13 lunar calender month if sirius do not rise in the 12th month. even though the length of the agricultural calendar still fluctuate with some year have 12 month and other have 13 it end up be much more reliable than it be before. they continually adjust it to the heliacal rising of sirius ensure that they never get too far off in they season. this new calendar be ideal because well it work well for agricultural purpose as well as for know when to have traditional religious festival. so that be they first calendar. but be it any way to run a government. they do not think so. for administrative purpose it be very inconvenient to have year of different length. so another calendar be introduce a administrative one. probably soon after 3 bc they declare a 365 day year with 12 month per year with exactly 3 day each month with a extra 5 day at the end of each year. this administrative calendar exist alongside the earlier agricultural and religious calendar that depend on the heliacal rising of sirius. this administrative calendar be much easier to use for thing like scheduling tax and other thing that have to be pay on time. over time the calendar get out of step with season and the flooding of the nile but for bureaucratic purpose they do not mind.",

        "context": "the word opera mean work actually it mean work. it be the plural of the word opus from the latin. and in italian it refer in general to work of art. opera lyrica or lyric opera refer to what we think of as opera the musical drama. opera be commonplace in italy for almost a thousand year before it become commercial as a venture. and during those year several thing happen primarily linguistic or thematic and both involve secularization. musical drama start in the church. it be a educational tool. it be use primarily as a vehicle for teaching religion and be generally present in latin the language of the christian church which have considerable influence in italy at that time. but the language of everyday life be evolve in europe and at a certain point in the middle age it be really only merchant aristocrat and clergy who could deal with latin. the vast majority of the population use they own regional vernacular in all aspect of they life. and so in what be now italy opera quit be present in latin and start be present in italian. and once that happen the theme of the opera presentation also start to change. and musical drama move from the church to the plaza right outside the church. and the theme again the theme change. and opera be no longer about teaching religion as it be about satire and about express the idea of society or government without commit yourself to write and risk imprisonment or persecution or what have you. opera as we think of it be of course a resurrect form. it be the melodious drama of ancient greek theater the term melodious drama be shorten eventually to melodrama because opera frequently be melodramatic not to say unrealistic. and the group that put the first opera together that we have today then be well it be a group of man that include galileo 's father vincenzo and they meet in florence he and a group of friend of the count of bardi and they form what be call the camerata dei bardi. and they take classical theater and reproduce it in the renaissance time. this uh this produce some of the opera that we have today. now what happen in the following century be very simple. opera originate in italy but be not confine to italy any more than italian be. and so as italian migrate across europe they carry theater with they and opera specifically because it be a italian form. what happen be that the major divide in opera that endure today take place. the french say opera ought to reflect the rhythm and cadence of dramatic literature bear in mind that we be talk about the golden age in french literature. and so the music be secondary if you will to the dramatic cadence of language to the way the rhythm of language be use to express feeling and use to add drama and of course as a result instead of aria or solo which would come to dominate italian opera. the french rely on what the italian call recitativo or recitative in english. the lyric be speak frequently to the accompaniment of a harpsichord. the french say you really can not talk about real people who live in opera and they rely on mythology to give they they character and they plot mythology the pastoral tradition the novel of chivalry or the epic of chivalry out of the middle age. the italian say no this be a great historical tool and what better way to educate the public about nero or attila or any number of people than to put they into a play they can see and listen to. the english appropriate opera after the french. opera come late to england because all theater public theater be close of course during they civil war. and it be not until the restoration in 166 that public theater again open and opera take off. the english make a major adjustment to opera and export what they have do to opera back to italy. so that you have this circle of musical influence the italian invent opera the french adapt it the english adopt it the italian take it back. it come to america late and be consider to elitist for the general public. but broadway musical fulfil a similar function for a great long while. john jay chapman write about opera quote if a extraterrestrial being be to appear before we and say what be you society like what be this earth thing all about you could do worse than take that creature to a opera. because opera do after all begin with a man and a woman and a emotion.",

        "question": "what be the lecture mainly about", 
        "context": "all right folk let 's continue we discussion of alternative energy source and move on to what be probably the most well know alternative energy source solar energy. the sun basically provide earth with virtually unlimited source of energy everyday but the problem have always be how do we tap this source of energy. can anyone think of why it be so difficult to make use of solar energy. because it be hard to gather it. solar energy be everywhere but it be also quite diffused. and the thing be the dream of solar energy be not a new one. humanity have be try to use the sun 's light as a reliable source of energy for century. and around the beginning of the 2 th century there be actually some primitive solar water heater on the consumer market. but they do not sell very well. any of you wan na guess why. well there be other energy choice like oil and natural gas right. and for better or for worse we choose to go down that path as a society. when you consider economic factor it be easy to see why. but then in the 197 's there be a interest in solar energy again. why do you think that happen. because oil and natural gas be err become scarce. the amount of oil and natural gas in the earth be still plentiful but there be other reason. it be a political thing really and i be gon na get into that now. so what happen in the 197 's be oil and natural gas become very expensive very quickly and that spur people to start look into alternative form of energy solar energy probably be the most popular. but then in the 8 's this trend reverse itself when the price of oil and natural gas go down. alright let 's shift we focus now to some of the technology that have be invent to overcome the problem of gather diffused solar energy. the most basic solution be simply to carefully place window in a building so that the sun shine into the building and then it be absorb and convert into heat. can anyone think of where this be most commonly use. yep greenhouse where plant be keep warm and provide with sunlight because the wall of the building be make entirely of glass. but we do also have more complex system that be use for space heating and they fall into two category passive and active heating system. passive system take advantage of the location or design of a house. for example solar energy be gather through large glass panel face the sun. the heat be then store in water fill tank or concrete. no mechanical device be use in passive heating system. they operate with little or no mechanical assistance. with active system on the other hand you collect the solar energy at one location and then you use pump and fan to move heat from the collector through a plumbing system to a tank where it can be use to heat a home or to just provide hot water. excuse i professor but i have get to ask how can solar energy work at night or on cloudy day. that be well that be a really good question. as a matter of fact science be still work on it try to find way of enhance energy storage technique so that the come of night or cloudy day really would not matter. that be the biggest drawback to solar energy. the problem of what do you do in case where the sun 's light be weak or virtually non present. so the storage of solar energy lot of solar energy be a really important aspect. do that mean that solar energy can only be use on a small scale like heat a home. well actually there have be some attempt to build solar energy power plant. the world 's largest solar power plant be located in kremer junction california. it can generate 194 megawatt of electric power but that be just a drop in the bucket. right now the utility company be interested in increase the capacity of the kremer junction plant but only time will tell if it will ever develop into a major source of power for that region consider the economic and political factor involve.",

        "context": "so continue we discussion of ecological system whole system. the main thing to keep in mind here be the interrelationship. the species in a system uh. and even the landscape itself they be interdependent. let 's take what you read for this week and see if we can apply this interdependence idea. well um how about beaver ecosystem with beaver and waterway. good good go on. like well you can see how it be so important cause if you go back before european settle in north america like before the 16 's back when native american be the only people live here well back then there be a lot of beaver but later on after european ok wait i see where you be head with this but before we go into how european settlement affect the ecosystem tell i this what kind of environment do beaver live in. think about what it be like before the european settler come we will come back to where you be head. ok well beaver live near stream and river and they block up the stream and river with like log and stick and mud. you know they build dam that really slow down the flow of the stream. so then the water back up and create like a pond that flood the nearby land. ok tell i more. well with wetland it be like there be more standing water more still water around and that water be a lot cleaner than swiftly flow water because the dirt and sediment and stuff have a chance to sink to the bottom. more important for we discussion wetland area support a lot more variety of life than swiftly flow water. for example there be more variety of fish or insect lot of frog spice and then species that rely on those species start to live near the wetland too. yes like bird and mammal that eat the fish and insect and you get tree and plant that begin to grow near the standing water that can not grow near the run water. oh and there be something about wetland and groundwater too. wetland have a big effect on groundwater the amount of water below the surface of the land. think of wetland as umm like a giant sponge the earth soak up a lot of this water that be continually flood the surface which increase the amount of water below. so where there be wetland you get a lot of groundwater and groundwater happen to be a big source of we own drinking water today. alright so back to the beaver what if the beaver be not there. you just have a regular run stream because there be no dam so the ecosystem would be completely different there would be fewer wetland. exactly so now let 's go back to where you be head before mike. you mention a change that occur after european come to north america. yeah well there use to be beaver all over the place something like 2 million beaver just in the continental united state. but when european come they start hunting the beaver for they fur because beaver fur be really warm and it be really popular for make hat in europe. so the beaver be hunt a lot overhunt they be almost extinct by the 18 's so that mean fewer wetland less standing water. and what do that mean for the ecosystem. well if there be less standing water then the ecosystem can not support as many species because a lot of insect and fish and frog can not live in run water and then the bird and animal that eat they lose they food supply. precisely so the beaver in this ecosystem be what we call a keystone species. the term keystone kind of explain itself. in architecture a keystone in a archway or doorway be the stone that hold the whole thing together and keep it from collapse. well that be what a keystone species do in a ecosystem. it be the crucial species that keep the system go. now beaver population be on the rise again but there be something to think about. consider human as part of these ecosystem you have probably hear about water shortage or restriction on how much water you can use especially in the summer time in recent year. and remember what i say about groundwater imagine if we still have all those beaver around all those wetland. what would we water supply be like then.",

        "context": "so last week we start we unit on residential architecture in the united state. so today we will be survey a number of architect who make contribution to residential architecture in the 19th century. now it be worth note that people who design home at that time probably have to deal with a certain amount of discouragement. since there be other architect who think it be more respectable to design the kind of building and maybe other structure that be less less utilitarian in they function. in fact a article from a 1876 issue of a journal call the american architect and building news state that and this be a quote they state that the planning of house be not architecture at all. so keep that journal article in mind as we look at the work of a architect name harriet morrison irwin. harriet morrison irwin be from the south bear in north carolina in 1828. at the time there be not many architect from the southern united state. and as you might imagine very few of they be woman. so irwin be really a pretty exceptional case. and she be not even formally train as a architect. she educational background be in literature. the above text be a transcript of this lecture prepare by lady bird qq519626928. so she just have like unnatural gift for architecture. she be actually a writer for several year. but she do have a penchant for math and engineering so she read a lot about it on she own. um especially the architectural essay write by the british critic john ruskin. and john ruskin believe what. um that building should have a lot of access to the outdoors to nature. ruskin say that be close to nature be great for people 's mental and physical health. so that be a influence. now harriet irwin 's contribution to architecture be relatively minor but still quite interesting and unique. she design a house with a hexagonal shape. a house with six side. instead of the standard you know four side home. the room inside the house be also hexagonal six side. so one important thing be that the room be arrange around a chimney in the center of the house which could provide heat for the whole house through flue uh small air passageway into each room as oppose to have a fireplace in every room which would require more cleaning and make the air inside the house dirtier. the house 's shape also allowedfor more window. each room have a large wall that could fit a couple of big winter give every room a nice view of the outdoors. plus there would be good airflow through the house. in warm weather when you can open all the window. the door to the house as well uh the house do not have a main entrance or any hallway. so there could be a couple of entry door in different place which like the window provide ready access to the outdoors. so what other advantage might there be to hexagonal room. what part of a room be usually the hardest to clean. like to sweep with a broom. because in square or rectangular room the corner be at 9 degree angle. it be hard to reach all the dust that gather in the corner. but if irwin 's room be closer to a circle than a square it would be easier to reach all the dust and dirt with a broom. now um biographer who write about irwin in the 19th century i feel sort of downplay the ingenuity of she design. but i think if she have design this house today the same biographer would praise she for come up with a floor plan that emphasize function efficient function of a house as well as a design that be creative and unique. in any case three house be build in irwin 's time that use she hexagonal design. and in 1869 when she be 41 irwin become the first woman in the united state to receive a patent for a architectural design. and that speak volume if you ask i.",

        "context": "as we have discuss bird be apparently descendant of dinosaur and share many commonality with some dinosaur species like um feather and maybe even flight and of course egg lay. so many paleontologist myself include have wonder about other similarity between dinosaur and bird. since adult dinosaur fossil have sometimes be discover near or on top of nest we have be look at the dinosaur parenting behavior. parenting behavior well that sound so gentle and caring. but dinosaur be ferocious reptile and reptile do not take care of they young do they. well some reptile incubate they egg crocodile do. and as for popular attitude towards dinosaur well take the oviraptor for instance. in the 192 's a paleontologist discover the fossil remains of a small dinosaur near a nest contain egg. he assume the dinosaur be steal the egg so he name it oviraptor that mean egg thief in latin which fuel the generally negative public image of such dinosaur. but by the 199 's other expert have convincingly make the case that instead of rob the nest the oviraptor be probably take care of the egg. you see dinosaur closest living relative bird and crocodile display nesting behavior. and dinosaur fossil have be find in posture that we now believe to indicate brooding behavior that be sit on the egg until they hatch. so we be curious about the type of care dinosaur give to they young. and we would like to figure out which dinosaur parent the male or the female give the care. should not the behavior of crocodile and bird give we some clue then. well with crocodile it be the female who guard the nest and with bird it depend on the species it can be the male or the female that take care the egg or both. in over 9 percent of all bird species both parent take care of the egg and the young bird. but sometimes it be just the male. well exclusive care by the male parent be much less common but it do occur. now for animal other than bird the care of young by both parent be pretty unusual in the animal kingdom. male contribute to parental care in fewer than five percent of all mammalian species. it be even less frequent among reptile. and exclusive care by the male be very rare. so researcher have wonder about the evolution of male parenting behavior in bird for quite some time. and now there be research show that for some of the bird dinosaur relative it be likely that the male parent be also in charge of take care of the egg. how do they figure that out. well first they look at clutch volume that be the number of egg in the nest of crocodile bird and three type of dinosaur include oviraptor that be think to be closely related to the dinosaur ancestor of bird. so when researcher examine fossilized remains of nest they find that the dinosaur have larger clutch volume more egg in the nest that be than most of the crocodile and bird that be study. but and this be important they clutch volume match those of bird that have only male parental care. you see bird species in which only the male take care of the nest tend to have the largest clutch of egg. so what be the connection between bird and dinosaur behavior. well researcher now believe because of this study that the male parenting behavior of these bird might have its origin in the behavior of dinosaur. base only on evidence of clutch volume size the number of egg. no there be more. they also examine the fossilized bone of those three type of dinosaur that be find on or near nest to determine they sex. you see adult female bird during egg production produce a layer of spongy bone tissue inside certain long bone. and so do female dinosaur of the kind that be investigate. this spongy tissue serve as a source of calcium for eggshell formation. but when the dinosaur fossil be examine there be no spongy bone deposit. mean that those dinosaur on the nest be probably adult male who would not have need calcium for make eggshell. and then there be this bird like the kiwi the ostrich and the emu they share certain physical characteristic with these dinosaur. and interestingly they also show a consistent pattern of nest care by the male.",

        "context": "alright everybody the topic for today be well we be gon na take a look at how to start create the character for the story you be write. one way of do that be to come up with what be call a character sketch i do not mean a sketch like a drawing i guess that be obvious. it be um it be a a sketch be a way of get start on define you character personality. to begin how do we create fictional character. we do not just pull they from thin air do we. i mean we do not create they out of nothing. we base they consciously or unconsciously we base they on real people or we blend several people 's trait they attribute into one character. but when people think fiction they may assume the character come from the author 's imagination. but the writer 's imagination be influence by by real people could be anyone so pay attention to the people you meet someone in class at the gym that guy who be always sit in the corner at the coffee house um you cousin who be always get into dangerous situation. we be pull from reality gather bit and piece of real people. you use these people and the bit of behavior or characteristic as a start point as you begin to sketch out you character. here be what you should think about do first. when you begin to formulate a story make a list of interesting people you know or have observe. consider why they be unique or annoying. then make note about they unusual or dominant attribute. as you create fictional character you will almost always combine characteristic from several different people on you list to form the identity and personality of just one character. keep this kind of character sketch can help you solidify you character 's personality so that it remain consistent throughout you story. you need to define you character know they personality so that you can have they act in way that be predictable consistent with they personality. get to know they like a friend you know you friend well enough to know how they will act in certain situation right. say you have three friend they car run out of gas on the highway. teresa take charge of handle the situation. and let 's say both john and mary defer to she leadership. they call you to explain what happen. and when john tell you he get mad you be not surprise because he always get frustrated when thing go wrong. then he tell you how teresa take charge calm he down assign task for each person and get they on they way. again you be not surprise. it be exactly what you would expect. well you need to know you character like you know you friend. if you know a lot about a person 's character it be easy to predict how they will behave. so if you character personality be well define it will be easy for you as the writer to portray they realistically er believably in any give situation. while write character sketch do think about detail. ask yourself question even if you do not use the detail in you story um what do each character like to eat what setting do each prefer the mountain the city what about educational background they reaction to success or defeat write it all down. but here i need to warn you about a possible pitfall. do not make you character into a stereotype. remember the reader need to know how you character be different from other people who might fall in the same category. maybe you character love the mountain and have live in a remote area for year. to make sure he be not a stereotype ask yourself how he see life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting. be careful not to make he into the clich of the ragged mountain dweller. okay now i will throw out a little terminology. major character be sometimes call round character. minor character be sometimes call well just the opposite flat. a round character be fully develop a flat character be not character development be fairly limit. the flat character tend to serve mainly as a motivate factor. for instance you introduce a flat character who have experience some sort of defeat. and then you round you main character who love success and love to show off come and boast about succeed and joke about the flat character 's defeat in front of other humiliate the other guy. the flat character be introduce solely for the purpose of allow the round character to show off.",

        "context": "professor the 19th century be the time that see what we call realism develop in the european theater. um to understand this though we first need to look at a earlier form of drama know as the well make play which basically be a pattern for construct play play that uh begin with some early 19th century comedy in france prove very successful commercially. the dramatic device use here be not actually anything new. they have be around for century. but the formula for a well make play require that the certain of these element be include in a particular order. and most importantly that everything in the play be logically connect. in fact some of these playwright would start by write the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning just to make sure each event lead logically from what have go before. ok so what be the necessary element of a well make play. well the first be logical exposition. exposition be whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience. so they will understand what be go on. before this time exposition might have come from actor simply give speech. someone might walk out on a stage and say in fair verona where we lay we scene. and then tell all about the feud family of romeo and juliet. but for the well make play even the exposition have to be logical believable. so for example you might have two servant gossip as they be clean the house. and one say oh what a shame the master 's son be still not marry. and the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who be just move into town with he beautiful daughter. these comment be part of the play 's logical exposition. the next key element of the a well make play be refer to as the incite incident. after we have the background information we need a key moment that get thing move that really make the audience interested in what happen to the character we just hear about. so for example after the two servant reveal all this background information we meet the young man. just as he first lay eye on the beautiful young woman and immediately fall in love. this be the incite incident. it set off the plot of the play. now the plot of a well make play be usually drive by secret. thing that the audience know but the character often do not know. so for example the audience learn through a letter or through someone else 's conversation who this mysterious gentleman be and why he leave the town many year before. but the young man do not know about this. and the woman do not understand the ancient connection between she family and he. and before the secret be reveal to the main character the plot of the play proceed as a series of sort of up and down moment. for example the woman first appear not to even notice the young man and it seem to he like the end of the world. but then he learn that she actually want to meet he too. so life be wonderful. then if he try to talk with she maybe she father get furious for no apparent reason. so they can not see each other. but just as the young man have almost lose all hope he find out well you get the idea the reversal of fortune continue increase the audience 's tension and excitement make they wonder if everything be go to come out okay or not. next comesan element know as the obligatory scene. it be a scene a moment in which all the secret be reveal. and generally thing turn out well for the hero and other we care about a happy ending of some sort. this become so popular that a playwright almost have to include it in every play which be why it be call the obligatory scene. and that be follow by the final dramatic element the denouement or the resolution when all the loose end have to be tie up in a logical way. remember the obligatory scene give the audience emotional pleasure. but the denouement offer the audience a logical conclusion. that be the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind. so as i say the well make play this form of playwriting become the basis for realism in drama and for a lot of very popular 19th century play. and also a pattern we find in the plot of many later play and even movie that we see today.",

        "context": "when land get develop for human use the landscape change. we do not see as many type of vegetation tree grass and so forth. this in turn lead to other loss the loss of animal that once live there. err but these be the obvious change but there be also less obvious change like the climate. one interesting case of this uh of change in the local land use cause change in climate specifically the temperature be in florida. now what come to mind when you think of the state of florida. florida have long have a great citrus industry large growth of orange lemon and the like. florida 's winter be very mild the temperature do not often get below freezing. but there be some area of florida that do freeze. so in the early 19 's farmer move even further south in florida to area that be even less likely to freeze. obviously freezing temperature be a danger to the crop. a bad bout of cold weather a long spell of frost could ruin a farmer 's entire crop anyway before the citrus grower move south much of the land in south florida be what we call wetland. wetland be area of marshy swampy land area where water cover the soil or be present either at or near the surface of the soil for a large part of the year. wetland have they own unique ecosystem with plant and animal with special and interesting adaptation. very exciting but it be not what we be talk about today. but the land be not suitable for farm. you can not grow orange in wetland so farmer have to transform the wetland into land suitable for farm. to do that you have to drain the water from the land move the water elsewhere and divert the water source such as river. hundred of mile of drainage canal be build in the wetland. now these area the new area the farmer move to use to be warm and unlikely to freeze however recently the area have become susceptible to freeze. and we be try to understand why. be it some global temperature change or weather pattern like el ni o or something. well there be two theory. one idea be as you suggest that major weather pattern something like el ni o be responsible. but the other idea and this be the one that i personally subscribe to be that the change in the temperature pattern have be bring about by the loss of the wetland. well how would loss of wetland make a difference. well think about what we have be study so far. we have discuss the impact of landscape on temperature right. what effect do a body of water have on a area. body of water tend to absorb the heat during the day and then they release the heat at night. what you just say be what i want you all to understand. body of water release heat and moisture back into the environment. so place near large body of water be generally milder err slightly warmer than those without water. and what i and other think be that the loss of the wetland have create a situation where the local temperature in the area be now slightly different slightly colder than they be 1 year ago before the wetland be drain. hmm do we know what the temperature be like back then. well we be able to estimate this. we have datum about south florida 's current landscape uh the plant cover. and we be able to reconstruct datum about its landscape prior to 19. then we enter those datum information about what the landscape look like before and after the wetland be drain. we enter the datum into a computer weather model. this model can predict temperature. and when all of the datum be enter a overall cooling trend be predict by the model. how much colder do it get now. well actually the model show a drop of only a few degree celsius. but this be enough to cause dramatic damage to crop. if temperature overnight be already very close to the freezing point then this drop of just a few degree can take the temperature below freezing. and freezing cause frost which kill crop. these damaging frost would not happen if the wetland be still in existence just a tiny temperature difference can have major consequence.",

        "question": "why do the professor talk about the break apart of earth 's continent", 
        "context": "ok let 's get start. today i want to talk about a way in which we be able to determine how old a piece of land or some other geologic feature be date technique. i be go to talk about a particular date technique. good date be key to good analysis. in other word if you want to know how a land formation be form the first thing you probably want to know be how old it be. uh take the grand canyon for instance. now we geologist think we have a pretty good idea of how the grand canyon in the southwestern united state be form. we know that it be form from sandstone that solidify somewhere between 15 and 3 million year ago. before it solidify it be just regular sand. essentially it be part of a vast desert. and until just recently most of we think the sand have come from a ancient mountain range fairly close by that flatten out over time. that be be the conventional wisdom among geologist for quite some time. but now we have learn something different and quite surprising use a technique call uranium lead date. i should say that uranium lead date have be around for quite a while. but there have be some recent refinement. i will get into this in a minute. anyway uranium lead date have produce some surprise. two geologist discover that about half of the sand from the grand canyon be actually once part of the appalachian mountain. that be really eye open news since the appalachian mountain range be of course thousand of kilometer to the east of the grand canyon. sound pretty unbelievable right. of course the obvious question be how do that sand end up so far west. the theory be that huge river and wind carry the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that be already there. well this be a pretty revolutionary finding. um and it be basically because of uranium lead date. well as everyone in this class should know we usually look at the grain type within sandstone mean the actual particle in the sandstone to determine where it come from. you can do other thing too like look at the wind or water that bring the grain to they location and figure out which way it be flow. but that be only useful up to a point and that be not what these two geologist do. uranium lead date allow they to go about it in a entirely different way. what they do be they look at the grain of zircon in the sandstone. zircon be a material that contain radioactive uranium which make it very useful for date purpose. zircon start off as molten magma the hot lava from volcano. and when zircon crystallize the uranium inside it begin to change into lead. so if you measure the amount of lead in the zircon grain you can figure out when the grain be form. after that you can determine the age of zircon from different mountain range. once you do that you can compare the age of the zircon in the sandstone in you sample to the age of the zircon in the mountain. if the age of the zircon match the age of one of the mountain range then it mean the sandstone actually use to be part of that particular mountain range. be everybody with i on that. so in this case uranium lead date be use to establish that half of the sandstone in the sample be form at the same time the granite in the appalachian mountain be form. so because of this this new way of do uranium lead date we have be able to determine that one of we major assumption about the grand canyon be wrong. like i say before uranium lead date have be with we for a while. but um until recently in order to do it you really have to study many individual grain. and it take a long time before you get result. it just be not very efficient. and it be not very accurate. but technical advance have cut down on the number of grain you have to study so you get you result faster. so i will predict that uranium lead date be go to become a increasingly popular date method. there be a few pretty exciting possibility for uranium lead date. here be one that come to mind. you know the theory that earth 's continent be once join together and only split apart relatively recently. well with uranium lead date we could prove that more conclusively. if they show evidence of once have be join that could really tell we a lot about the early history of the planet 's geology.",

        "context": "ok we have be talk about early agriculture in the near east. so let 's concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it. let 's look at catalhoyuk. um i would better write that down. catalhoyuk that be about as close as we get in english. it be turkish really. the site 's in modern day turkey and who know what the original inhabitant call it. anyway uh catalhoyuk be not the first agricultural settlement in the near east but it be pretty early settle about 9 year ago in the neolithic period. and um the settlement uh town really last about a thousand year and grow to a size of about eight or ten thousand people. that certainly make it one of the largest town in the world at that time. one of the thing that make the settlement of this size impressive be the time period. it be the neolithic remember the late stone age. so the people that live there have only stone tool no metal. so everything they accomplish like build this town they do with just stone plus wood brick that sort of thing. but you get to remember that it be not just any stone they have they have obsidian. and um obsidian be a black volcanic well almost like glass. it flake very nicely into really sharp point. the sharpest tool of the entire stone age be make of obsidian. and uh the people of catalhoyuk get theirs from further inland from central turkey trade for it probably. anyway what i wan na focus on be the way the town be build. the house be all rectangular one storey make of sun dry brick. but what be really interesting be that there be no space between they no street in other word and so generally no door on the house either. people walk around on the roof and enter the house through a hatchway on the roof down a wooden ladder. you can still see the diagonal mark of the ladder in the plaster on the inside wall. once you be in the house there would be one main room and a couple of small room for storage. the main room have the hearth for cooking and for heat. it would have be pretty cold during the winter. and it also look like they make they tool near the fire. there tend to be a lot of obsidian flake and chip in the hearth ash but no chimney. the smoke just go out the same hatchway that people use for go in and out themselves. so there would have be a open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. you and i would have find it a bit too smoky in there. you can see on the wall which they plaster and decorate with painting. they end up with a layer of black soot on they and so do people 's lung. the bone find in the grave show a layer of soot on the inside of the rib. and that be another unusual feature of catalhoyuk the burial site. the grave have all be find under the house right under the floor. and it maybe this burial custom that explain why the house be pack in so tightly without street. i mean you might think it be for protection or something but there have be no evidence find yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger. it maybe they want to live as near as possible to they ancestor grave and be bury near they themselves. but it make a good point. base on excavation we can know the layout of the house and the location of the grave but we be only guess when we try to say why they do it that way. that be the way it be with archeology. you be deal with the physical remain that people leave behind. we have no sure access to what they think and how they feel about thing. i mean it be interesting to speculate. and the physical artifact can give we clue but there be a lot we can not really know. so for instance they art. they paint on the plastered wall and usually they paint hunting scene with wild animal in they. now they do hunt and they also raise cereal crop and keep sheep but we do not know why so many of the painting be of hunting scene. be it suppose to have religious or magical significance. that be the kind of thing we can only guess at base on clue. and hopefully further excavation of catalhoyuk will yield more clue. but we will probably never know for sure.",

        "context": "ok we have be talk about early agriculture in the near east. so let 's concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it. let 's look at catalhoyuk. um i would better write that down. catalhoyuk that be about as close as we get in english. it be turkish really. the site 's in modern day turkey and who know what the original inhabitant call it. anyway uh catalhoyuk be not the first agricultural settlement in the near east but it be pretty early settle about 9 year ago in the neolithic period. and um the settlement uh town really last about a thousand year and grow to a size of about eight or ten thousand people. that certainly make it one of the largest town in the world at that time. one of the thing that make the settlement of this size impressive be the time period. it be the neolithic remember the late stone age. so the people that live there have only stone tool no metal. so everything they accomplish like build this town they do with just stone plus wood brick that sort of thing. but you get to remember that it be not just any stone they have they have obsidian. and um obsidian be a black volcanic well almost like glass. it flake very nicely into really sharp point. the sharpest tool of the entire stone age be make of obsidian. and uh the people of catalhoyuk get theirs from further inland from central turkey trade for it probably. anyway what i wan na focus on be the way the town be build. the house be all rectangular one storey make of sun dry brick. but what be really interesting be that there be no space between they no street in other word and so generally no door on the house either. people walk around on the roof and enter the house through a hatchway on the roof down a wooden ladder. you can still see the diagonal mark of the ladder in the plaster on the inside wall. once you be in the house there would be one main room and a couple of small room for storage. the main room have the hearth for cooking and for heat. it would have be pretty cold during the winter. and it also look like they make they tool near the fire. there tend to be a lot of obsidian flake and chip in the hearth ash but no chimney. the smoke just go out the same hatchway that people use for go in and out themselves. so there would have be a open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. you and i would have find it a bit too smoky in there. you can see on the wall which they plaster and decorate with painting. they end up with a layer of black soot on they and so do people 's lung. the bone find in the grave show a layer of soot on the inside of the rib. and that be another unusual feature of catalhoyuk the burial site. the grave have all be find under the house right under the floor. and it maybe this burial custom that explain why the house be pack in so tightly without street. i mean you might think it be for protection or something but there have be no evidence find yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger. it maybe they want to live as near as possible to they ancestor grave and be bury near they themselves. but it make a good point. base on excavation we can know the layout of the house and the location of the grave but we be only guess when we try to say why they do it that way. that be the way it be with archeology. you be deal with the physical remain that people leave behind. we have no sure access to what they think and how they feel about thing. i mean it be interesting to speculate. and the physical artifact can give we clue but there be a lot we can not really know. so for instance they art. they paint on the plastered wall and usually they paint hunting scene with wild animal in they. now they do hunt and they also raise cereal crop and keep sheep but we do not know why so many of the painting be of hunting scene. be it suppose to have religious or magical significance. that be the kind of thing we can only guess at base on clue. and hopefully further excavation of catalhoyuk will yield more clue. but we will probably never know for sure.",

        "question": "accord to the professor why do some blackcap choose a secondary habitat", 
        "context": "well last time we talk about passive habitat selection like plant for example they do not make active choice about where to grow. they be disperse by some other agent like the wind. and if the seed land in a suitable habitat they do well and reproduce. with active habitat selection a organism be able to physically select where to live and breed. and because a animal 's breed habitat be so important we would expect animal species to have develop preference for particular type of habitat place where they offspring have the best chance of survival. so let 's look at the effect this preference can have by look at some example. but first let 's recap. what do we mean by habitat. well it be basically the place or environment where a organism normally live and grow. right and as we v discuss there be some key element that a habitat must contain food obviously water it be get to have the right climate and space for physical protection. and we see how important habitat selection be when we look at habitat where some of these factor be remove perhaps through habitat destruction. i just read about a shorebird the plover. the plover live by the ocean and feed on small shellfish insect and plant. it blend in with the sand so it be well camouflage from predator bird above. but it lay its egg in shallow depression in the sand with very little protection around they. so if there be people or dog on the beach the egg and fledgling in the nest be really vulnerable. out in california where there have be a lot of human development by the ocean. the plover be now a threaten species. so conservationist try to recreate a new habitat for they. they make artificial beach and sand bar in area inaccessible to people and dog. and the plover population be up quite a bit in those place. that be a instance where a habitat be make less suitable. but now what about case where a animal exhibit a clear choice between two suitable habitat. in case like that do the preference matter. well let 's look at the blue warbler. the blue warbler be a songbird that live in north america. they clearly prefer hard wood forest with dense shrub bush underneath the tree. they actually nest in the shrub not the tree. so they be pretty close to the ground but these warbler also nest in forest that have low shrub density. it be usually the younger warbler that nest in these area because the preferred spot where there be a lot of shrub be take by the older more dominant bird. and the choice of habitat seem to affect reproductive success. because the older more experienced bird who nest in the high density shrub area have significantly more offspring than those in low density area which suggest that the choice of where to nest do have a impact on the number of chick they have. but a preferred environment do not always seem to correlate with greater reproductive success. for example in europe study have be do of blackcap warbler. we just call they blackcap. the blackcap can be find in two different environment. they prefer habitat be forest near the edge of stream. however blackcap also live in pine wood away from water. study have be do on the reproductive success rate for the bird in both area and the result show surprisingly that the reproductive success be essentially the same in both area the preferred and the second choice habitat. it turn out that there be actually four time as many bird pair or couple live in the stream edge habitat compare to the area away from the stream. so this stream edge area have a much denser population which mean more member of the same species compete for resource want to feed on the same thing or build they nest in the same place which lower the suitability of the prime habitat even though it be they preferred habitat. so the result of the study suggest that when the number of the competitor in the prime habitat reach a certain point the second rank habitat become just as successful as the prime habitat just because there be fewer member of the same species live there. so it look like competition for resource be another important factor in determine if a particular habitat be suitable.",

        "context": "some of the world 's oldest preserved art be the cave art of europe most of it in spain and france. and the earliest cave painting find to date be those of the chauvet cave in france discover in 1994. and you know i remember when i hear about the result of the date of the chauvet painting i say to my wife can you believe these painting be over 3 year old. and my 3 year old daughter pipe up and say be that older than my great grandmother. that be the oldest age she know. and you know come to think of it. it be pretty hard for i to really understand how long 3 year be too. i mean we tend to think that people who live at that time must have be pretty primitive. but i be gon na show you some slide in a few minute and i think you will agree with i that this art be anything but primitive. and they look so real so alive that it be very hard to imagine that they be so very old. now not everyone agree on exactly how old. a number of the chauvet painting have be date by a lab to 3 or more year ago. that would make they not just older than any other cave art but about twice as old as the art in the cave at altamira or lascaux which you may have hear of. some people find it hard to believe chauvet be so much older than altamira and lascaux and they note that only one lab do the date for chauvet without independent confirmation from any other lab. but be that as it may whatever the exact date whether it be 15 2 or 3 year ago the chauvet painting be from the dawn of art. so they be a good place to start we discussion of cave painting. now one thing you have get to remember be the context of these painting. paleolithic human that be the period we be talk about here the paleolithic the early stone age not too long after human first arrive in europe the climate be significantly colder then and so rock shelter shallow cave be value as home protect from the wind and rain. and in some case at least artist draw on the wall of they home. but many of the truly great cave art site like chauvet be never inhabit. these painting be make deep inside a dark cave where no natural light can penetrate. there be no evidence of people ever live here. cave bear yes but not human. you would have have to make a special trip into the cave to make the painting and a special trip to go see it. and each time you would have to bring along torch to light you way. and people do go see the art. there be charcoal mark from they torch on the cave wall clearly date from thousand of year after the painting be make. so we can tell people go there. they come but they do not stay. deep inside a cave like that be not really a place you would want to stay so why. what inspire the paleolithic artist to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible place. we will never really know of course though it be interesting to speculate. but um get to the painting themselves virtually all paleolithic cave art represent animal and chauvet be no exception. the artist be highly skilled at use or even enhance the natural shape of the cave wall to give depth and perspective to they drawing the sense of motion and vitality in these animal. well wait till i show you the slide. anyway most paleolithic cave art depict large herbivore. horse be most common overall with deer and bison pretty common too probably animal they hunt. but earlier at chauvet there be a significant interest in large dangerous animal lot of rhinoceros lion mammoth bear. remember that the range of many animal species be different back then so all these animal actually live in the region at that time. but the chauvet artist do not paint people. there be a half man half bison creature and there be outline of human hand but no depiction of a full human. so why these precise animal. why not bird fish snake. be it for they religion magic or sheer beauty. but whatever it be it be worth it to they to spend hour deep inside a cave with just a torch between they and utter darkness. so on that note let 's dim the light so we can see these slide and actually look at the technique they use.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what objection do some researcher raise with regard to the dolphin study", 
        "context": "we have be talk about animal cognition the study of animal intelligence. now much of the research in this area be motivate by the search for animal analogue or parallel to human cognitive process. and one of the process we have be investigate be metacognition. well it be be aware of what one know or feel uh um have a awareness of one 's state of mind. and make decision about behavior base on what one know. researcher have long be interested in whether animal possess this capability but but could not test it because animal be not able to report they feeling. but recently one group of researcher find a way to solve this problem. they do study with with monkey and dolphin that provide evidence that these animal have the ability to feel uncertainty to feel unsure about something and and well to know that they be uncertain. so how could these researcher figure out if a animal feel uncertainty. well it begin with a study one of they do on a dolphin who have be train to recognize a particular high pitched tone. the dolphin be teach to press one of two paddle depend on whether it hear the high tone or one that be lower. food be a reward for a correct response. but if the wrong paddle be press the dolphin have to wait several seconds before it could try again. the task vary in difficulty accord to the pitch of the second tone. the closer it come in pitch to the first one the hard it become for the dolphin to correctly identify it as low. and the researcher note that the dolphin be quite eager to press the paddle when it be sure of the answer but exhibit hesitation during difficult trial. next the researcher introduce a third option a third paddle that would initiate a new trial give the dolphin the choice of pass on difficult trial. once the dolphin figure out the result of press this new paddle it do choose it frequently when the trial be difficult. the researcher take that as a indication that the animal want to pass because it do not know the answer and know it do not know. but there be a problem. other researcher protest that the the opt out response be simply a learn or condition response. you remember intro to psychology right. in other word by press the pass paddle the dolphin avoid have to wait and hasten the possibility of a full reward by move directly to the next trial. so the experiment do not necessarily indicate that the dolphin have knowledge of its own uncertainty just that it want to avoid negative consequence. so more recently we researcher and he colleague devise a new study this time use monkey. in this experiment the monkey have to identify certain pattern display on a computer screen. these pattern be analogous to the tone use in the dolphin study. one type of pattern be of a specific density and be to be classify as dense while the second type of pattern could vary in density but be always less dense than the first one. and the monkey task be to identify this second type as sparse. so the denser the second type of pattern be the more difficult the task become. and as in a previous study the monkey be give a third choice that would allow they to pass on to a new trial. but unlike in the dolphin experiment the monkey have to complete four trial before they get any feedback. they do not know if they respond correctly or incorrectly after each trial because there be no reward or punishment. at the end of four trial feedback be give. the monkey receive a full reward for each correct response. and a time out during which a buzzer be sound for each incorrect response. but the monkey have no way to tell which reward or punishment be associate with which response. and they do not get either reward or punishment for choose the pass option the um the uncertainty response. but nevertheless they still choose this option in the appropriate circumstance when the trial be particularly difficult. and this be evidence that it be not a conditioned response because that response do not guarantee a faster reward. so what do all this tell we about animal consciousness or animal awareness of themselves and they state of mind. can we really know what be go on in the mind of animal. but explore the metacognitive capacity of animal could become a important criterion in highlight the similarity and difference between human and animal mind. id nd4u ydmx88c pg pa317 lpg pa317 dq metacognition dolphin press paddle source bl ot co2_da3olo sig fsfz5eeouh j spyqmofbcisny hl en sa x ei d_bjucn9e6t7yghe4ogqcw ved cecq6aewba v onepage q metacognition 2 dolphin 2 press 2 paddle f false.",

        "context": "we have be talk about the decline of coral reef in tropical area all over the world um how natural and man make stress be cause they to degrade and in some case to die. so now let 's focus on a specific example of a natural predator that can cause a lot of damage to coral reef the crown of thorn or cot starfish. the cot starfish be find on coral reef in the tropical pacific ocean and it eat coral. now in small number the starfish do not affect coral reef dramatically. but periodically starfish population explode. and when that happen the reef can become badly damage or even destroy something we be try very hard to prevent. for example during the 196 's there be a outbreak of cot starfish in the great barrier reef off the east coast of australia. luckily the cot starfish population gradually decline on its own and the reef recover. but we be leave wonder what cause the population to increase so suddenly. well over the year we have come up with a few hypothesis. one hypothesis be that it be a natural phenomenon that the starfish naturally undergo population fluctuation follow particularly good spawning year. there be also several hypothesis that suggest some sort of human activity be partly responsible like fishing. there be fish and snail that eat starfish particularly the giant triton snail which be the main predator of the starfish. these fish and snail have themselves experience a decline in population because of overfishing by human. so with a decline in starfish predator the starfish population can increase. another hypothesize human related cause be fertilizer runoff. people use fertilizer for they crop and plant and a lot of it eventually make its way from land into the sea. it be fertilizer so it have a lot of nutrient. these nutrient have a effect on the starfish because they cause a increase in the growth of phytoplankton. phytoplankton be microscopic plant that grow in the ocean. larval cot starfish eat phytoplankton in they first month of life so more fertilizer in the ocean mean more phytoplankton which mean more starfish bad for the reef. now the final hypothesis have to do with storm event. if some reef be destroy by storm starfish population that inhabit those reef would have to condense and concentrate on the reef that be leave. so this can cause a kind of mass feeding frenzy. so we have idea but no real answer. and because we be not sure of the cause for starfish population increase it be difficult to prevent they. i mean some progress have be make. for example new survey technique have enable we to detect population increase when the starfish be quite young so we can be ready for they. but meaningful progress require much better evidence about the cause. on the bright side in all the research be do on cause we have discover something related to how starfish population might affect coral reef diversity. we think that when reef be damage after a few year the fastest grow coral repopulate the area. and these fast grow species can grow over the slower grow species of coral deny they light and prevent they from recovery. however the faster grow species be the preferred food of the cot starfish. so when a outbreak of cot starfish occur they thin out the fast grow coral and may give the slower one a chance to reestablish. so without the outbreak the diversity of coral would be reduce.",

        "question": "why do the professor mention nonnative species", 
        "context": "since we be go to talk about change in animal population in the wild i would like to ask about somethingus read in a article online about how the population size of some animal species can affect other animal species and how other environmental factor come into play too. relationship between animal species in a give ecosystem can get pretty complex. because in addition to predator prey relationship there be other variable that affect population size. the article mention that population of predator and they prey might go up rapidly and then decline all of a sudden. i read about that in my ecology class. i think that be call a boom and bust cycle. well hold on a second. first i want to go over some key concept. let 's say there be a species that have access to plenty of food and ideal condition. under those circumstance its population would increase exponentially mean it would increase at a ever accelerate pace. that sound a little scary. well it do not usually happen. like you say a rapid population growth be often follow by a sudden decline. but we do occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative species when they be transplant into a new environment. um because they face little competition and have favorable grow condition. but for most species most of the time resource be finite. there be only so much available which lead i to my point. every ecosystem have what we call a carry capacity. the carry capacity be the maximum population size of a species that can be sustain by the resource of a particular ecosystem. resource be of course food water and just as important space. although every species have a maximum rate at which the population of that species could increase assume ideal condition for the species in its environment. there be always go to be environmental factor that limit population growth. this be call environmental resistance. environmental resistance be important becauseit stop population from grow out of control. factor such food supply predation and disease affect population size and can change from year to year or season to season. i think i get it. well let 's look at a case study. that should make thing clear. some year ago some of my colleague conduct a experiment in a oak forest involve three different species white footed mouse gypsy moth and oak tree. the above text be a transcript of this lecture prepare by lady bird qq519626928. now let i explain what the situation be in this forest. oak tree produce acorn and acorn be a primary food source for white footed mouse. another food source for the white footed mouse be the gypsy moth. so the size of the gypsy moth population be control by the white footed mouse which be a good thing because gypsy moth caterpillar be consider pest. they strip away the leaf from the oak tree every ten year or so. so the mouse eat both acorn from the oak tree and gypsy moth. and the gypsy moth caterpillar eat oak tree leave. now what make this set of relationship particularly interesting be that oak tree only produce a large number of acorn every few year. so during the year with fewer acorn the white footed mouse have to deal with a smaller food supply. but in the year with large amount of acorn the mouse have more food which lead to. the white footed mouse population grow. and the gypsy moth population decrease. how can we know that for sure. it seem like a big jump from more acorn to fewer gypsy moth. well we can know for sure because in this oak forest the researcher decide to test the link between acorn and the two animal species. in some part of the forest they have volunteer drop a large number of extra acorn on the forest floor. and in another section of the forest they remove a number of white footed mouse. in the forest area where extra acorn have be drop the gypsy moth population soon go into a significant decline. but in the section of the forest where the white footed mouse have be remove the gypsy moth population explode.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what factor lead to the rapid distribution of notothenioid throughout the southern ocean", 
        "context": "way in which animal adapt to they environment be often quite ingenious actually. and as a example of this let i tell you about a fish a group of fish know as the notothenioid. there be over 9 known species of notothenioid and they inhabit both shallow and very deep water mostly around antarctica. many be fairly small though the largest species can weigh up to 15 kilogram. notothenioid can be identify by they large eye which be cover by a thick insulate layer of clear tissue. this tissue protect they eye from freezing. remember the freezing point of ocean water salt water be lower than for fresh water negative 1. so it can get a lot colder for fish in a ocean say than in a river or lake. so this mean that the ocean water around antarctica be cold enough to freeze most type of fish but notothenioid do not freeze. in fact they thrive. they account for some 95 of all fish in the southern ocean the ocean that surround antarctica. so how unusual be that. to have a single family of fish dominate a entire ocean. i mean think of say tropical or temperate marine environment which have incredibly diverse fish population. coral reef for example support over 4 type of fish along with sponge crustacean and many other organism. so exactly when and how do the notothenioid come to dominate the southern ocean. well around 3 million year ago the water around antarctica be a lot warmer than they be today. um at that time antarctica be connect to south america which mean that warm air from the north could flow southward and heat up the antarctica water. because the water around antarctica then be relatively warm it support many type of fish. and we know this from fossil evidence. but the 9 or so species of notothenioid that exist today do not exist at all back then. in fact only one ancestral notothenioid species exist. but somewhere between 5 million and 14 million year ago two major change take place. first what we call a chance mutation. a tiny genetic change occur in that one notothenioid species. its dna allow for the production of a special protein a protein that prevent the fish from freezing. the way this this anti freeze protein work be it bind to any ice crystal that form inside the fish. this binding action prevent the ice crystal from grow larger. and this be what prevent notothenioid from freezing. now at that time the water the notothenioid inhabit be still not freezing cold so the protein do not really make a difference as far as the fish 's survival. but this would change because in the same period of geologic time there be a shift in the earth 's continental plate. continental drift cause antarctica to move apart from the landmass of south america and to drift into the southern polar region. this result in a powerful water current encircle antarctica which prevent the antarctic water from mix with warmer water. so the southern ocean isolate from that warm airflow from the north cool down drastically to the kind of sub freezing temperature we associate with it today. now most fish species could not survive in this frigid environment and they become extinct. but that one notothenioid species with its unique ability to produce that anti freeze protein thrive. it have virtually the entire southern ocean to itself. well there be little or no competition for food or space. you might think of it as um as a a kind of ecological vacuum. and the notothenioid exploit fully. the species migrate into different habitat throughout the southern ocean. and its population increase dramatically with various sub population migrate into different part of the ocean. over time these sub population in all those different habitat well they develop very different physical trait. they adapt to survive in they particular ecological niche they they position within a particular ecosystem. we call this type of species diversification within a species adaptive radiation. and what adaptive radiation be be a evolutionary process by which a parent species rapidly undergo change result in various new species in order to fill multiple ecological niche. so in the case of the notothenioid that single species start colonize empty habitat to such a extent that it evolve into a broad range of new species the 9 or so notothenioid species that we have today. so let i switch to adaptive radiation with regard to another species that be also be very successful.",

        "context": "ok i have a interesting plant species to discuss with you today. uh it be a species of a very rare tree that grow in australia eidothea hardeniana but it be better know as the nightcap oak. now it be discover only very recently just a few year ago. um it remain hidden for so long because it be so rare. there be only about 2 of they in existence. they grow in a rain forest in a mountain rage range in the north part of new south wale which be uh a state in australia. so just 2 individual tree in all. now another interesting thing about the nightcap oak be that it be it represent uh a very old type uh kind of tree that grow a hundred million year ago. um we find fossil that old that bear remarkable resemblance to the tree. so it be a primitive tree. a a living fossil you might say. it be relic from earlier time and it have survive all these year without much change. and it it be probably a kind of tree from which other tree that grow in australia today evolve. just to give you a idea of what we be talk about. here be a picture of the leaf of the tree and its flower. i do not know how well you can see the flower. they be those little cluster sit at the base of the leaf. okay what have we try to find out about the tree since we have discover it. hmm or how why be be it so rare. it be one of the first question. um how be it um how do it reproduce. um maybe those two question be actually related. hmm i do not know. but i can imagine that for instance seed dispersal might be a factor. i mean if the er you know if the seed can not really disperse in the wild area then you know the tree may not colonize new area. it can not spread from the area where it be grow. that be that be actually a very good answer. uh of course you might think there might not be many area where the tree could spread into er because um well it be very specialize in term of the habitat. but that be not really the case here. um the suitable habitat that be the actual rainforest be much larger than the few hectare where the nightcap oak grow. now this tree be a flowering tree as i show you. um um it produce a fruit much like a plum. on the inci inside there be a seed with a hard shell. it it appear that the shell have to crack open or break down somewhat to allow the seed to soak up water. you know if the nightcap oak remain if they seed remain lock inside they shell they will not germinate. actually the seed er they do not retain the power to germinate for very long maybe two year. so there be actually quite a short window of opportunity for the seed to germinate. so the shell somehow have to be break down before this um germination ability expire. and and then there be a kind of rat that like to feed on the seed as well. so give all these limitation not many seed that the tree produce will actually germinate. so this be a possible explanation for why the tree do not spread. it do not necessarily explain how it become so rare but it explain why it do not increase. ok so it seem to be the case that the species this nightcap oak be not very good at spread. however it seem though we can not be sure that it be very good at persist as a population. um we there be some indication to suggest that the population of the nightcap oak have not decline over the last. er you know many hundred of year. so it be stay quite stable. it be not a remnant of some huge population that be dwindle in the last few hundred year for some reason. it be not necessarily a species in retreat. ok so it can not spread very well but it be good at maintain itself. it be rare but it be not disappear. ok the next thing we might want to ask about a plant like that be what chance do it have to survive into the future. let 's look at that.",

        "context": "professor the 19th century be the time that see what we call realism develop in the european theater. um to understand this though we first need to look at a earlier form of drama know as the well make play which basically be a pattern for construct play play that uh begin with some early 19th century comedy in france prove very successful commercially. the dramatic device use here be not actually anything new. they have be around for century. but the formula for a well make play require that the certain of these element be include in a particular order. and most importantly that everything in the play be logically connect. in fact some of these playwright would start by write the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning just to make sure each event lead logically from what have go before. ok so what be the necessary element of a well make play. well the first be logical exposition. exposition be whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience. so they will understand what be go on. before this time exposition might have come from actor simply give speech. someone might walk out on a stage and say in fair verona where we lay we scene. and then tell all about the feud family of romeo and juliet. but for the well make play even the exposition have to be logical believable. so for example you might have two servant gossip as they be clean the house. and one say oh what a shame the master 's son be still not marry. and the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who be just move into town with he beautiful daughter. these comment be part of the play 's logical exposition. the next key element of the a well make play be refer to as the incite incident. after we have the background information we need a key moment that get thing move that really make the audience interested in what happen to the character we just hear about. so for example after the two servant reveal all this background information we meet the young man. just as he first lay eye on the beautiful young woman and immediately fall in love. this be the incite incident. it set off the plot of the play. now the plot of a well make play be usually drive by secret. thing that the audience know but the character often do not know. so for example the audience learn through a letter or through someone else 's conversation who this mysterious gentleman be and why he leave the town many year before. but the young man do not know about this. and the woman do not understand the ancient connection between she family and he. and before the secret be reveal to the main character the plot of the play proceed as a series of sort of up and down moment. for example the woman first appear not to even notice the young man and it seem to he like the end of the world. but then he learn that she actually want to meet he too. so life be wonderful. then if he try to talk with she maybe she father get furious for no apparent reason. so they can not see each other. but just as the young man have almost lose all hope he find out well you get the idea the reversal of fortune continue increase the audience 's tension and excitement make they wonder if everything be go to come out okay or not. next comesan element know as the obligatory scene. it be a scene a moment in which all the secret be reveal. and generally thing turn out well for the hero and other we care about a happy ending of some sort. this become so popular that a playwright almost have to include it in every play which be why it be call the obligatory scene. and that be follow by the final dramatic element the denouement or the resolution when all the loose end have to be tie up in a logical way. remember the obligatory scene give the audience emotional pleasure. but the denouement offer the audience a logical conclusion. that be the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind. so as i say the well make play this form of playwriting become the basis for realism in drama and for a lot of very popular 19th century play. and also a pattern we find in the plot of many later play and even movie that we see today.",

        "question": "which sentence best describe eyeglass before the invention of the printing press", 
        "context": "so we have be talk about the printing press how it change people 's life make book more accessible to everyone. more book mean more reading right. but as you know not everyone have perfect vision. this increase in literacy um in reading lead to a increase in demand for eyeglass. and here 's something you probably have not think of. this increase demand impact societal attitude towards eyeglass. but first let i back up a bit and talk about vision correction before the printing press. and um what do people with poor vision do i mean especially those few people who be actually literate. what do they do before glass be invent. well they have different way of deal with not see well. if you think about it poor vision be not they only problem. i mean um think about the condition they live in house be dark sometimes there be not any window candle be the only source of light. so in some place um like ancient greece for example the wealthiest people with poor vision could have someone else read to they easy solution if you could afford it. another solution be something call a reading stone. european monk would take a piece of clear rock often quartz and place it on top of the reading material. the clear rock magnify the letter make they appear larger um well it be like what happen when a drop of water fall on something whatever 's below the drop of water appear larger right. well the reading stone work in a similar way. but rock like quartz well quartz of optical quality be not cheap. late in the 13th century glass maker in italy come up with a less expensive alternative. they make read stone out of clear glass. and these clear glass reading stone evolve into the eyeglass we know today. so we be pretty sure that glass be invent about the late 12 's well over a hundred year before the printing press. but it be not clear who exactly invent they first or exactly what year. but record show that they be invent in both europe and china at about the same time. by the way we call this independent discovery. independent discovery mean when something be invent in different part of the world at the same time and it be not as unusual as it sound. you can look at the timeline chart in the back of you textbook to see when thing be invent in different culture at about the same time to see what i be talk about. so now let 's tie this to what i have say before about societal attitude towards glass. initially in part of europe and in china glass be a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. this be evident in the artwork from the period. european painting often portray doctor or judge wear glass. in china glass be very expensive. so in addition to intelligence they also symbolize affluence um wealth. in 14th century chinese portrait the bigger the glass the smarter and wealthier the subject be. so glass be a status symbol in some part of the world. now let 's get back to the invention of the painting press in 144. suddenly book become readily available and more people want to read. so the need oh well actually not only the need but the demand for more affordable glass rise drastically. eventually inexpensive glass be produce and then glass be available to everyone. people could purchase they easily from a travel peddler.",

        "question": "what be the professor 's opinion about the relationship between english landscape painter and loutherbourg", 
        "context": "as we have see the second half of the 18th century be a exciting time in europe it be not only a age of great invention but social change also lead to a rise in all sort of entertainment from read to museum to travel. and find himself in the middle of this excitement be a accomplished french painter name philippe jacque de loutherbourg. loutherbourg arrive in england in 1771 and immediately go to work as a set designer at the famous drury lane theater in london. from he first show loutherbourg show a knack for imagination and stage design all in the interest of create illusion that allow the audience to suspend disbelief completely. he accomplish this by give the stage a greater feeling of depth which he do by cut up some of the rigid background scenery and place it at various angle and distance from the audience. another realistic touch be use three dimensional object on the set like rock and bush as oppose to two dimensional paint scenery. he also pay much more attention to lighting and sound than have be do before. now these set be so elaborate that many people attend the theater more for they than for the actor or the story. at the time people be wild for travel and for experience new place but not everyone could afford it. loutherbourg outdo himself however with a show that he set up in he own home. he call it the eidophusikon. eidophusikon mean something like representation of nature and that be exactly what he intend to do create realistic move scene that change before the audience eye. in this he synthesize all he trick from drury lane mechanical motion sound light other special effect to create if you will a early multimedia production. the eidophusikon be loutherbourg 's attempt to release painting from the constraint of the picture frame. after all even the most action fill exciting painting can represent only one moment in time and any illusion of movement be go after the first glance. but loutherbourg like other contemporary painter want to add the dimension of time to he painting. you know the popular thinking be that loutherbourg be influence by landscape painting. but why can not we say that the eidophusikon actually influence the painter. at the very least we have to consider that it be more it be more of a mutual thing. we know for example that the important english landscape painter thoma gainsborough attend almost all of the early performance and he later painting be notable for they increase color and dynamic use of light. loutherbourg 's influence on the theater though he be incredibly influential the way he bring together design and lighting and sound as a unify feature of the stage can easily be see in english theater 's subsequent emphasis on lighting and motion. now the eidophusikon stage be actually a box a few meter wide a couple meter tall and a couple meter deep. that be the action take place within this box. this be much smaller of course than the usual stage. but it also allow loutherbourg to concentrate the lighting to better effect. also the audience be in the dark which would not be a common feature of the theater until a hundred year later. the show consist of a series of scene for example a view of london from sunrise that change as the day move on mechanical figure such as cattle move across the scene and ship sail along the river. but what really get people be the attention to detail much like he work at drury lane. so for example he paint very realistic ship and vary they size depend on they distance from the audience. small boat move more quickly across the foreground than larger one do that be closer to the horizon. other effect like wave be also very convincing. they reflect sunlight or moonlight depend on the time of day or night. even the color change as they would in nature. sound and light be important in make he production realistic. he use a great number of lamp and he be able to change color of light by use variously color piece of glass to create effect like pass cloud that suddenly change in color. furthermore he use effect to make pattern of shadow and light rather than use the uniform lighting that be common at the time. and many of the sound effect he pioneer be still in use today like create thunder by pull on one of the corner of a thin copper sheet. one of he most popular scene be of a storm. and there be a story that on one occasion a actual storm pass over head during the show. and some people go outside and they claim loutherbourg 's thunder be actually better than the real thunder.",

        "context": "almost all animal have some way of regulate they body temperature otherwise they would not survive extreme hot or cold condition sweating panting swim to cooler or warmer water duck into somewhere cool like a burrow or a hole under a rock these be just a few. and that spot be colder or warmer than the surrounding environment because it be a microclimate. a microclimate be a group of climate condition that affect a localized area weather feature like temperature wind moisture and so on. and when i say localized i mean really localized because microclimate can be as the name suggest pretty small even less than a square meter. and microclimate be affect by huge number of other variable. obviously weather condition in the surround area be a factor. but other aspect of the location like um the elevation of the land the plant life nearby and so on have a substantial effect on microclimate. and of course the human development in the area um a road will affect a nearby microclimate. it be also interesting to note that microclimate that be near each other can have very different condition. in the forest for example there can be a number of very different microclimate close to each other because of all the variable i just mention. so how do a hole in the ground a burrow stay cool in a hot climate. well since cold air sink and these spot be shaded they be usually much cooler than the surround area. and these spot be so important because many animal rely on microclimate to regulate they body temperature. um for instance there be a species of squirrel in the western part of the united state that can get really hot when they be out forage for food. so they need a way to cool down. so what do they do. they go back to they own burrow. once they get there they body temperature decrease very very quickly. the trip to the burrow prevent the squirrel from get too hot. but squirrel be mammal right. i think mammal regulate they temperaturemammal do have the ability to regulate they body temperature but not all can do it to the same degree or even the same way. like when you walk outside on a hot day you perspire and you body cool itself down a classic example of how a mammal regulate its own body temperature. but one challenge that squirrel face well many small mammal do be that because of they size sweating would make they lose too much moisture. but on the other hand they small size allow they to fit into very tiny space. so for small mammal microclimate can make a big difference. they rely on microclimate for survival. so cold blood animal like reptile they can not control they own body temperature so i can imagine the effect a microclimate would have on they. yes many reptile and insect rely on microclimate to control they body temperature. a lot of reptile use burrow or stay under rock to cool down. of course with reptile it be a balancing act. stay in the heat for too long can lead to problem but stay in the cold can do the same. so reptile have to be really precise about where they spend they time even how they position they body. and when i say they be precise i mean it some snake will search out a place under rock of a specific thickness because too thin a rock do not keep they cool enough and too thick a rock will cause they to get too cold. that level of precision be critical to the snake for maintain its body temperature. and even microscopic organism rely on microclimate for survival. think about this decompose leaf create heat that warm the soil the warm soil in turn affect the growth the condition of organism there. and those organism then affect the rate of decomposition of the leaf. so a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that even a tiny change can have a big impact. if someone on a hike knock a couple of rock over they could be unwittingly destroy a microclimate that a animal or organism rely on.",
