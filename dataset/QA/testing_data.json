        "context": "a mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period short geologically speak that be like when the dinosaur die out 65 million year ago. and the fossil record it indicate that in all the time that animal have inhabit earth there have be five great mass extinction dinosaur be the most recent. in each of the other up to half of all land animal and up to 95 percent of marine species disappear. well today we be witness a sixth mass extinction but unlike the other the current loss of bio diversity can be trace to human to human activity. since the stone age human have be eliminate species and alter ecosystem with astounding speed. countless species have disappear due to over hunting habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation pollution and other unnatural human cause. so as a way of repair some of that damage a group of conservation biologist have propose a ambitious or some might say a radical plan involve large vertebrate or megafauna. megafauna include elephant wild horse big cat camel large animal. eh actually the proposal focus on a particular subset of megafauna the kind that live during the pleistocene epoch. the pleistocene epoch most commonly know as the ice age stretch from 1. 8 million to 11 5 year ago. in the america many megafauna begin disappear by the end of the pleistocene. so here be the biologist idea. take a select group of animal megafauna from place like africa and asia and introduce they into other ecosystem similar to they current home begin in the united state. they call they plan pleistocene rewilding. now the advocate of pleistocene rewilding cite two main goal. one be to help prevent the extinction of some endanger megafauna by provide new refuge new habitat for they. the other be to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that have be lose in north america. what do i mean by restore evolutionary potential. well as you know the evolution of any species be largely influence by its interaction with other species. so during the pleistocene epoch let 's take the now extinct american cheetah for instance. we believe it play a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope the antelope 's amazing speed to be exact because natural selection would favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah. when the american cheetah disappear they influence on the evolution of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animal stop. so it be conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have continue to evolve get faster maybe if the cheetah be still around. that be what be mean by evolutionary potential. import african cheetah to the western united state could in theory put the pronghorn back onto its uh natural evolutionary trajectory accord to these biologist. another example be the interaction of megafauna with local flora in particular plant that rely on animal to disperse they seed. like pleistocene rewilding could spark the re emergence of large seed american plant such as the maclura tree. many type of maclura use to grow in north american buy today just one variety remain and it be find in only two state. in the distant past large herbivore like mastodon disperse maclura seed each the size of a orange in they dropping. well there be not any mastodon leave but there be elephant which descend from mastodon. introduce elephant into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seed like they ancestor do. restore some of the former balance to the ecosystem. but as i allude to earlier pleistocene rewilding be extremely controversial. a big worry be that these transplant megafauna might devastate plant and animal that be native to the western united state. in the year since the pleistocene epoch native species have adapt to the change environmental there plant smaller animal they have be evolve without megafauna for millennium. also animal species that go extinct 11 year ago uh some be quite different genetically from they modern day counterpart like elephant do not have thick coast like they mastodon ancestor do when they graze the prairie of the america west during the ice age. grant the climate today be not as cold as it be in the pleistocene. but winter on the prairie can still get pretty harsh today. and there be many more consideration. well you see how complex this be. if you think about it though the core problem with this sixth mass extinction be human interference. pleistocene rewilding be base on good intention but you know it probably would just be more of the same thing.",

        "question": "accord to the professor how do the american cheetah influence the pronghorn antelope during the pleistocene epoch", 
        "context": "a mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period short geologically speak that be like when the dinosaur die out 65 million year ago. and the fossil record it indicate that in all the time that animal have inhabit earth there have be five great mass extinction dinosaur be the most recent. in each of the other up to half of all land animal and up to 95 percent of marine species disappear. well today we be witness a sixth mass extinction but unlike the other the current loss of bio diversity can be trace to human to human activity. since the stone age human have be eliminate species and alter ecosystem with astounding speed. countless species have disappear due to over hunting habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation pollution and other unnatural human cause. so as a way of repair some of that damage a group of conservation biologist have propose a ambitious or some might say a radical plan involve large vertebrate or megafauna. megafauna include elephant wild horse big cat camel large animal. eh actually the proposal focus on a particular subset of megafauna the kind that live during the pleistocene epoch. the pleistocene epoch most commonly know as the ice age stretch from 1. 8 million to 11 5 year ago. in the america many megafauna begin disappear by the end of the pleistocene. so here be the biologist idea. take a select group of animal megafauna from place like africa and asia and introduce they into other ecosystem similar to they current home begin in the united state. they call they plan pleistocene rewilding. now the advocate of pleistocene rewilding cite two main goal. one be to help prevent the extinction of some endanger megafauna by provide new refuge new habitat for they. the other be to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that have be lose in north america. what do i mean by restore evolutionary potential. well as you know the evolution of any species be largely influence by its interaction with other species. so during the pleistocene epoch let 's take the now extinct american cheetah for instance. we believe it play a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope the antelope 's amazing speed to be exact because natural selection would favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah. when the american cheetah disappear they influence on the evolution of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animal stop. so it be conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have continue to evolve get faster maybe if the cheetah be still around. that be what be mean by evolutionary potential. import african cheetah to the western united state could in theory put the pronghorn back onto its uh natural evolutionary trajectory accord to these biologist. another example be the interaction of megafauna with local flora in particular plant that rely on animal to disperse they seed. like pleistocene rewilding could spark the re emergence of large seed american plant such as the maclura tree. many type of maclura use to grow in north american buy today just one variety remain and it be find in only two state. in the distant past large herbivore like mastodon disperse maclura seed each the size of a orange in they dropping. well there be not any mastodon leave but there be elephant which descend from mastodon. introduce elephant into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seed like they ancestor do. restore some of the former balance to the ecosystem. but as i allude to earlier pleistocene rewilding be extremely controversial. a big worry be that these transplant megafauna might devastate plant and animal that be native to the western united state. in the year since the pleistocene epoch native species have adapt to the change environmental there plant smaller animal they have be evolve without megafauna for millennium. also animal species that go extinct 11 year ago uh some be quite different genetically from they modern day counterpart like elephant do not have thick coast like they mastodon ancestor do when they graze the prairie of the america west during the ice age. grant the climate today be not as cold as it be in the pleistocene. but winter on the prairie can still get pretty harsh today. and there be many more consideration. well you see how complex this be. if you think about it though the core problem with this sixth mass extinction be human interference. pleistocene rewilding be base on good intention but you know it probably would just be more of the same thing.",

        "context": "i be talk to one of my colleague in the physics department the other day and we end up discuss how one discovery can change everything. my colleague mention how the theory of relativity completely change the field of physics. at any rate that conversation get i think about archaeological find that really change we understanding of ancient civilization. so i want to talk about the discovery of the antikythera mechanism. the antikythera mechanism be find a hundred year ago under water in a ancient greek shipwreck in the mediterranean sea. it be in extremely poor condition and in many corroded piece. but once we figure out what it be and reconstruct it. well i simply do not have the word to convey how extraordinary this find be. the antikythera mechanism be a relatively small device roughly the size of a shoebox make of gear fit inside a wooden case. in its original state there be rotate dial and other indicator on the top with letter and drawing show the sun the phase of the moon and different constellation. inside the box bronze gear would have rotate the display. the display uh the indicator of the antikythera mechanism would then move to show the motion of the sun and moon relative to the planet and star. the device could be use to tell the different phase of the moon and much more. well scientist have recently analyze the inscription on the mechanism and re examine the other cargo in the ship wreck and the evidence make a absolute case that this device date back to ancient greece somewhere between 15 and 1 b. what make that so fascinating be that before we find the antikythera mechanism the earliest device we have that could track the sun and moon like this be invent over 1 year later. so when this be first find people literally would not believe it. some of my colleague insist it have to have be make well after 1 b. but this physical evidence be conclusive. of course part of what make this find so unusual be that the antikythera mechanism be construct of bronze. now it be not that bronze be all that rare in greece then it be just that bronze be valuable and could easily be recycle. it would have be relatively easy for a person with knowledge of metal to melt down bronze object and forge they into. well say coin. bronze be use to make money back then. or mold the bronze into anything else of value for that matter. we be very fortunate that the device end up under water because otherwise it probably would have end up recycle into. now it be a challenge to figure out the antikythera mechanism. it spend over 2 year at the bottom of the sea before it be discover. and even after it be discover it be still a number of year before we really understand what it be. you see the mechanism have corrode underwater and many of the gear be stick together in a mass. clean it be only partly successful. we could only get a good look at the structure of the gear after gamma ray be use to see inside very similar to the way x ray be use to see you bone. now once we get a good look inside we see a really complex device. the many gear not only move in a way that could indicate the phase of the moon. the antikythera mechanism also track both the lunar year and the solar year. additionally the gear also move to match the motion of the planet and predict eclipse. but one thing that be particularly notable be that the mechanism be so precise that it even take into account a particular irregularity in the moon 's orbit which require some very complex math to replicate in mechanical device. you could say that the antikythera mechanism be a very precise calendar which stand to reason calendar be very important to ancient people. religious festival have to be hold at the right time of year crop need to be plant at the right time as well. and let 's not forget that eclipse in planetary motion have important symbolic meaning.",

        "question": "accord to the professor what be the two main goal of pleistocene rewinding", 
        "context": "a mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period short geologically speak that be like when the dinosaur die out 65 million year ago. and the fossil record it indicate that in all the time that animal have inhabit earth there have be five great mass extinction dinosaur be the most recent. in each of the other up to half of all land animal and up to 95 percent of marine species disappear. well today we be witness a sixth mass extinction but unlike the other the current loss of bio diversity can be trace to human to human activity. since the stone age human have be eliminate species and alter ecosystem with astounding speed. countless species have disappear due to over hunting habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation pollution and other unnatural human cause. so as a way of repair some of that damage a group of conservation biologist have propose a ambitious or some might say a radical plan involve large vertebrate or megafauna. megafauna include elephant wild horse big cat camel large animal. eh actually the proposal focus on a particular subset of megafauna the kind that live during the pleistocene epoch. the pleistocene epoch most commonly know as the ice age stretch from 1. 8 million to 11 5 year ago. in the america many megafauna begin disappear by the end of the pleistocene. so here be the biologist idea. take a select group of animal megafauna from place like africa and asia and introduce they into other ecosystem similar to they current home begin in the united state. they call they plan pleistocene rewilding. now the advocate of pleistocene rewilding cite two main goal. one be to help prevent the extinction of some endanger megafauna by provide new refuge new habitat for they. the other be to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that have be lose in north america. what do i mean by restore evolutionary potential. well as you know the evolution of any species be largely influence by its interaction with other species. so during the pleistocene epoch let 's take the now extinct american cheetah for instance. we believe it play a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope the antelope 's amazing speed to be exact because natural selection would favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah. when the american cheetah disappear they influence on the evolution of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animal stop. so it be conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have continue to evolve get faster maybe if the cheetah be still around. that be what be mean by evolutionary potential. import african cheetah to the western united state could in theory put the pronghorn back onto its uh natural evolutionary trajectory accord to these biologist. another example be the interaction of megafauna with local flora in particular plant that rely on animal to disperse they seed. like pleistocene rewilding could spark the re emergence of large seed american plant such as the maclura tree. many type of maclura use to grow in north american buy today just one variety remain and it be find in only two state. in the distant past large herbivore like mastodon disperse maclura seed each the size of a orange in they dropping. well there be not any mastodon leave but there be elephant which descend from mastodon. introduce elephant into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seed like they ancestor do. restore some of the former balance to the ecosystem. but as i allude to earlier pleistocene rewilding be extremely controversial. a big worry be that these transplant megafauna might devastate plant and animal that be native to the western united state. in the year since the pleistocene epoch native species have adapt to the change environmental there plant smaller animal they have be evolve without megafauna for millennium. also animal species that go extinct 11 year ago uh some be quite different genetically from they modern day counterpart like elephant do not have thick coast like they mastodon ancestor do when they graze the prairie of the america west during the ice age. grant the climate today be not as cold as it be in the pleistocene. but winter on the prairie can still get pretty harsh today. and there be many more consideration. well you see how complex this be. if you think about it though the core problem with this sixth mass extinction be human interference. pleistocene rewilding be base on good intention but you know it probably would just be more of the same thing.",

        "context": "many people have be fascinate about venus for century because of its thick cloud cover this so call planet of mystery and all of that. well what be under those cloud. what be the surface of the planet like. some question about the surface be still unresolved but but we have learn a lot about it in the past several year. first of all let i talk about how we have be able to get past those cloud. first there be soviet modules2 that land directly on the surface and send back some image of what be around they. second we do some radar imaging from satellite from above. radar can get through the cloud. so what have we learn. well i remember read that there be not really a lot go on that the surface of venus be just flat and smooth in a lot of place. yeah smooth in a lot of place. but that be not um that be not the whole picture. in other area you have get canyon rip valley meteo crater uh lava dome these lava formation that look like giant pancake. well one of the most interesting feature on the surface be in fact the shield volcano. shield volcano form when magma come out of the ground in the same spot over and over again. remember magma be hot molten rock that be underground and it be call lava when it reach the surface. uh so the lava build up and harden and a volcano form. now the lava on venus be thin. so shield volcano have very gentle sloping side. they be call shield volcano because view from above they kind of resemble shield you know like a warrior 's shield. but what be particularly interesting about these volcano be that most of the volcano here on earth be not shield volcano. instead they be other volcano type like strata volcano for example which be a result of tectonic plate movement. underneath the earth 's crust there be a number of shift slab or plate that be slowly move. and in the zone on the edge of the plate where different plate meet and interact that be where we get most of earth 's volcanoeson venus however volcano be not cluster in discrete zone like they be on earth. instead they be more or less randomly scatter over venus 's surface. well that be significant. venus have mostly shield volcano and they be randomly scatter that indicate that venus do not have move tectonic plate and that be a big difference compare to earth. here on earth move tectonic plate be a major geological element just crucial for the whole surface dynamic right. so why do not venus have they. well there be a few theory. one of they be that this have to do with the fact that venus have no surface water that be need to kind of lubricate the movement of the plate you know like ocean on earth. yeah i forget to spell that out. uh venus have no surface water. do you say we have shield volcano on earth. can you give a example. the volcano in the hawaii island in the pacific ocean be shield volcano. they be form over a hot spot of magma. so while on earth we have several type of volcano on venus there be mostly the one type. be the volcano on venus still active. well that be a interesting question. there be still some discussion on that point. but here be what we do now. first the level of sulfur dioxide gas above venus 's cloud show large and very frequent fluctuation. it be quite possible that these fluctuation the huge increase and decrease of sulfur dioxide happen again and again. it be quite possible that this be due to volcanic eruption because volcanic eruption often emit gas. if that be the case volcanism could very well be the root cause of venus 's thick cloud cover. and also we have observe burst of radio energy from the planet 's surface. these burst be similar to what we see when volcano erupt on earth. so this too suggest ongoing volcanic activity. but although this be intriguing evidence no one 's actually observe a venus volcano erupt yet so we can not be positive.",
